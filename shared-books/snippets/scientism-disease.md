## What Causes Disease

All living things are complex orders that have been ideally adapted to the environments where they have been crafted by natural selection. As life/order is evolving in complexity from the hypothetical first self-replicators to single cells, these orders must maintain their order living in an environment of relative biochemical chaos. Once we get to cells we now have a membrane that can create a more stable environment within the cell where more complexity can arise without getting disordered by some foreign molecules/matter. As this is happening mechanisms that repair or help restore biochemical order or prevent high levels of disoder within the cell are evolving.

a living thing is healthy when the biochecmical order is in the idealy naturally selected or evolved state.

As natural selection evolved solitary cells, it had to evolve mechanisms that kept
