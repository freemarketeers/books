##### Scientific mythology arising out of biochemical and socioeconomic complexity. How so many "experts" can be so wrong



In the following sections we hope to make it obvious to the reader that much of mainstream "science" is nearly as mythical, misguided, and intolerant as the famed Spanish Inquisitors were. It is understandable how this can seem somewhat shocking. Can so many well-intentioned and very smart people-scientists-"experts" be so blind to their errors and continue to act in a manner that is doing immense harm? Seems so improbable right? However, consider the following. Today organized religion like the Catholic Church employs thousands of priests-theologians who preach various ideas with various degrees of belief which are actually impossible to prove in a real tangible sense. We would assume that some priests really believe much of what the Church preaches, some might have some doubt to various degrees, and we can also expect some to be 100% charlatans who might be atheists and even pedophiles. Many of these people are very bright, highly educated, very well read in history and other subjects and speak many languages yet the incentive and ideological structure still persists and does both much good and bad. We also just discussed how out of the complexity of the socioeconomic order Socialist-Communist mythology arose leading to oppressive-competition-immune-'central planning' governments all over the world which were-are also populated by smart and caring people who believed the various economic fallacies to various degrees. Again, wherever there is complexity or doubt or lack of certainty (afterlife, complex social order, mind, biochemistry) there is bound to be mythology and resulting competitionless-monopoly-coercive-governments to coordinate the mythical ideas-plans-solutions making them much more difficult to change. Let us begin to prepare our minds for this rather difficult-to-swallow and dangerous idea by seeing just how utterly misguided "mainstream science" and the "experts" have been in the recent past.

In 1847 [Ignaz Semmelweis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis) realized that by doctors just washing their hands, the mortality rate of mothers giving birth at the time could be reduced drastically (from about 16% to 1%). Regardless of his superb results, the medical establishment of the time, in other words, the "experts" and "great minds", fought and ridiculed his advise and he died a depressed man. [Alfred Wegener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener#Continental_drift_theory) was the originator of the theory of continental drift (later renamed-revised as 'plate tectonics') by hypothesizing in 1912 that the continents are slowly drifting around the Earth. His ideas were also rejected by the scientific establishment (the "experts") which even held a special symposium just to criticize them. In 1926 Johannes Fibiger was recognized by the "experts" of the day when he was given the Nobel Price in Medicine for the wonderful discovery that a particular worm was the cause of cancer. The "experts" and Johannes were embarrassingly wrong. In 1935 Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz performed the first lobotomy (removing/slicing parts of brain) and would win the Nobel Prize in 1949. Paul A. Offit writes: 

>"The New York Times hailed Moniz as "a brave explorer of the human brain." Over the next three decades more than 40,000 lobotomies were performed across the globe, 20,000 in the United states alone. But lobotomies didn't cure anything. Rather they caused memory loss, seizures, and occasionally fatal uncontrollable bleeding. By the 1970s lobotomies were relegated to the dusty bin of discarded psychiatric therapies next to whips,chains [and snake pits."](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Advice-Paul-A-Offit-MD-audiobook/dp/B07MXPDGYN/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=paul+offit+bad+advice&qid=1604277456&sr=8-1) (Offit, p. 4)

Then there are the countless Communist ideologues-"scientists"-"experts" and today's mainstream Keynesian economists which we will revisit further below.

Bottom line. As Henry H. Bauer writes:

>"If the overwhelming consensus were always right, then combustion would still be regarded as a release of phlogiston, the splitting of atoms would still be regarded as impossible, and so on. Progress means discarding theories formerly held and defended by an overwhelming consensus."

So how can so many "experts" be so wrong? Few things are as important as our health and our fears of death. When it comes to health and religion there is a sort of tremendous selective pressure that ensures that both doctors and theologians carry themselves with additional certainty. A change in ideas here means the existing religion-doctors were wrong in vitally important things so it makes sense that these two bureaucracies evolve certain incentives which fight change even more. The great economist and historian Thomas Sowell twitted April in 2020:

>"People will forgive you for being wrong, but they will never forgive you for being right—especially if events prove you right while proving them wrong."

And a related quote by famed physicist  Max Plank:

>“A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”

Bottom line, there is an understandable 'echo chamber' of NEGLIGENCE that causes new ideas to spread slowly as the always proudful apes have to admit to being wrong and also losing their paychecks.
   

Since religion has historically been the state-government which is not only immune from competition but can also sustain its views via force-threats-inquisitions it becomes even easier to see how such ideas-bureaucracies are more immune to change. Why should we think that today's "scientists" are somehow immune from similar attitudes of the past and also not currently making monumental errors? A tiny amount of reason and humility is all that is needed to realize that in all likelihood there are many ideas which currently dominate "scientific consensus" which are bound to be wrong, and by simply looking at today's dissenters we are looking at potential Galileos.

The image above is the latest simulation (guess) that some NASA scientists have created of what a cell looks like. The tiniest dots you see are proteins which contain tens or hundreds of thousands of atoms each(protein TRP-cage has 127, Titin has 539,022) linked together in a very precise order leading to structures of very specific shapes which can go from useful to useless or dangerous if just one atom is off or if the resulting structure itself simply bends the wrong way because it collided with a 'free-radical' or a heavy-big mercury atom. Imagine a large auto-manufacturing plant that employs 2,000 men operating complex machinery and suddenly having a few laborers make a 45 degree turn or do the same with the complex robotics. You'd still have 2,000 men and robotics, but you'd have an unproductive chaos. Just doing this to one machine, or just one little part of one machine, will be enough to wreck the whole factory or assembly line for days-months-ever. Men-machines-things that are part of life don't just exist, they exist in a very specific or complex ORDER which is maintained by very precise INFORMATION and an existing and precise chain-reaction of events. Everything in the private sector is owned and thus controlled or coordinated by a mind that is interested in reordering it in the most useful-productive-profitable way possible. Something similar has evolved in the biochemical order. Also, imagine if to "study" the factory, first you had to immerse it in water thus killing all the workers and causing electrical malfunctions which stopped the plant leading to various chaotic scenarios. Whenever a "scientist" shows you some fancy "electron microscope" image of what the biochemical world supposedly looks like, you are seeing a dead cell that had to be interfered with or prepared in numerous ways making it nearly impossible for us to really predict how the living cell actually worked. Lester and Parker write:

>"The nature of these procedures is described by Dr Harold Hillman in his previously cited 2011 article entitled Cell Biology at the Beginning of the 21st Century is in Dire Straits, which bears repetition,
>>“When a tissue is prepared for histology, histochemistry, electron microscopy, or immunochemistry, an animal is killed; the tissue is excised; it is fixed or frozen; it is embedded; it is
sectioned; it is rehydrated; it is stained; it is mounted; it is radiated by light, or bombarded by
electron beams.”

>Although this refers to the study of animal tissue, the same, or very similar, procedures are employed
in the study of diseased tissue obtained from a human patient, but these procedures, as well as the
chemicals used as stains and fixatives, directly affect the tissue samples, which are clearly no longer
alive when observed. Furthermore, the laboratory apparatus and the laboratory itself are sterile
environments that bear no resemblance whatsoever to the natural environment of the tissue samples within
the human body, from which they have been removed. Unfortunately, as discussed in chapter three,
researchers are mostly oblivious of the extent to which their preparation procedures affect the samples
they study." (Lester, p. 670)


These are just some of the numerous complexities to keep in mind when trying to understand the mind-bogglingly complex biochemical order. There are many "carrier proteins" like the famous HDL and LDL whose job is to carefully-safely-orderly-purposely move stuff-cholesterol around. The proteins themselves are manufactured in large mega-molecules called ribosomes which read mRNA to determine the proper sequence of amino acids to stitch together to make the protein.

Consider the following example. In 2005, aided by a supercomputer that had 768 processors and ran on-task for 260 days, researchers came up with a computer simulation that guessed what a ribosome might look like and how it might work as it read some mRNA to create a protein.

>"The task wasn't simple. Researchers had to model the physical interactions of each of 2.64 million atoms--about 250,000 in the ribosome itself, but most involving water molecules inside and outside it. The simulation resulted in a movie that is 20 million frames long, he said....In reality, however, the ribosome behavior that they simulated takes only 2 nanoseconds, or 2 billionths of a second--too short to even be [labeled as "fleeting." "](https://www.cnet.com/news/lab-computer-simulates-ribosome-in-motion/#:~:text=The%20task%20wasn't%20simple,molecules%20inside%20and%20outside%20it.) (Shankland)

Let that sink in... With our fanciest computers, electron microscopes, and other impressive sounding technologies, as late as 2005 the best we could do is somewhat guess, for just 2 nanoseconds, what one ribosome might look like-function. It took another 4 years, till 2009, for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to be given to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Thomas A. Steitz and Ada E. Yonath, "for studies of the structure and function of the ribosome". How did they achieve this? How did they gather the evidence for their amazing breakthroughs and future simulations? The Noble Prize website summarizes:

>"The story of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry begins in hot springs and in the Dead Sea. Ada Yonath used micro-organisms from these extreme environments to isolate robust ribosomes. Her goal was to make the ribosomes crystallize, like salt in a solution crystallizes when the water evaporates. After many years of trial and error, Ada Yonath managed to generate well organized crystals with millions of ribosomes assembled into regular patterns."

>Ada Yonath sent X-rays through ribosome crystals. When the rays hit the crystal’s atoms they are scattered, making millions of dots on a CCD detector. This method is called X-ray crystallography. By analysing the pattern of the dots, researchers can determine the positions of the hundreds of thousands of atoms in the ribosome. However, scientists also needed to know the “phase angle” for each and every dot. This mathematical information is related to the location of the atoms in the crystal. In 1998, Thomas Steitz managed to solve the phase problem and the first crystal structure of the ribosome’s large subunit was published." (Yonath)


So…Dead crystallized ribosomes, bombarded by X-rays, leaving a shadow, followed by numerous mathematical equations and other layers upon layers of assumptions-hypotheses (guesses), dealing with immense complexity, just to come up with a good enough guess to impress fellow apes of the scientific community and get the Prize. Our ability to biochemically identify one of these proteins-molecules-structures and alter it in a useful-predictable manner that also does not negatively affect other proteins-molecules-processes is currently INEXISTENT. The simple truth is that how the biochemical world functions is still far far far far far too complex for the slightly smarter apes to have the technology-means to interact with in ways that when one properly accounts for all the potential side-effects of our numerous drugs and vaccines clearly proves to be an improvement in the long run for many things we are currently doing. We see this all the time as old drugs-treatments, which were hyped as revolutionary at the time when the scientific community was focused on the drug's positive effects as they relate to the condition they want to improve, are found to do more harm than good once the complex side-effects are better understood and eventually traced to the drug-intervention. The seemingly positive effects are easy to see when that is what they are focused on and there is tremendous financial incentive for good news, the negative effects are much, much harder to see and there is no money to be made in doing so for the most part, especially if convoluted government regulations make companies immune from or more difficult to sue when things go wrong.


As our ability to understand biochemistry increased, we kept focusing on how particular compounds-medicines could affect the proximate symptoms of various diseases. Successes there and continued technological breakthroughs regarding our ability to understand such complex biochemistry just led to drugs-poisons which got a little better at treating the symptoms. I mentioned 'poisons' because that is exactly what drugs are, they are poisons which at certain doses superficially improve or block some symptoms we focus on, but given the mindbogglingly complex biochemistry of the human body, they inevitably cause imbalances-chaos in other areas which go largely unnoticed. Eat all the meat you want and your body will properly make the most of it because that is what our biochemistry has been ideally evolved to process, swallow the bottle of pills and the reality that they are poisons will quickly manifest itself. Consider the following, the US General Accounting Office published a study which found that "…of the 198 drugs approved by the FDA between 1976 and 1985… 102 (or 51.1%) had serious post-approval risks" (risks=heart-kidney-liver failure, birth defects-etc.) We have reached the point where the medical system itself via errors and side-effects of drugs and many other factors is estimated to be the 3rd leading [cause of death.](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/study_suggests_medical_errors_now_third_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us) This should not be seen as an attack on the pharmaceutical industry, we just want to appreciate the immense complexity and still relative backwardness of our ability to properly understand, and much less interfere with, the biochemical world. Remember, it wasn't until 2009 that we even got a good enough guess of what a ribosome may look like, so it should be unsurprising that the better we understand the biochemical world, the better we realize that we had been doing much harm. Of special importance and toxicity are chemotherapy drugs. The theory behind chemotherapy drugs is that they are immensely toxic but hopefully more so to the cancerous cells we want to kill, than to our non-cancerous cells which we can hopefully replenish. None of the drugs we use "cure" anything, they just alleviate or delay certain symptoms whose root causes are usually related to nutrition and-or environmental toxins, etc. 


If a cure-improvement-information involves not doing anything or there is less money to be made in it, less money exists to advertise it and spread such information. But if the remedy-information does involve big profits, then there is money-wealth to motivate the spread of this idea, so the "invasive" remedy-information is sort of "naturally selected". And, once gain, if the money-wealth comes from a competitionless-monopolistic government institution then the potential fallacies are even harder to change. So the 'incentive structure' that evolves is one that fools the slightly smarter apes into long-term and hard-to-notice and change disasters. The politicians and masses only see the alleged benefits of a government-coercive-competitionless intervention into the socioeconomic order-economy-'complex phenomena', while being unaware of the fact that usually the cost will be greater than the perceived benefit. Something similar happens here. This has little to do with some "conspiracy" by the doctors or pharmaceutical industry to keep people away from superior ideas(although this certainly happens and is also a factor to various degrees), this is just the way things have inadvertently evolved to various degrees and is also "indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design". Again, we must always be focused on the root cause of our problems. It is the economic ignorance of the masses-experts which calls for the creation of the paralyzing-competitionless-inefficient bureaucracies which get more incompetent-malicious-neglective with time, which then leads to some truly corrupt-incompetent-negligent-clueless apes-Lysenkos-Faucis. This is a monumentally important fact!!!! Again!!! Just like in the Catholic Church one can find pedophile priests who don't believe in God or at least many of the 'myths' the Church preaches, especially today when we have so much science-genetics-etc. to at least cause doubt in some of the myths, it would be a monumental mistake to point to those examples and then label organized religion as some "conspiracy" of liars. If the incentive and ideological structure that maintains organized religion and its much-easier-to-criticize potential myths can still be so prevalent, we should expect the same pattern repeating itself in areas involving far more difficult to understand complexity (biochemical order-medicine, "theoretical" physics, the brain-psychiatry, 'climate change', history, economy, etc.) 

We should stress that in each of these complex fields like religion, nutrition, disease, economics, history, we get mythological structures which should NOT be confused with purposeful-coordinated "conspiracies". When one looks at the leading voices in the low-carb-keto(and more recently carnivore) community, essentially people who have major disagreements with mainstream science when it comes to nutrition and diseases in this example, people like 1) [Dr. Timothy Noakes, who had to defend his low-carb views against the existing medical bureaucracy in a manner akin to Galileo defending himself vs. the Church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OT_S6fDxR0&list=PLPda1Yn6bpO6DG_b5_wAVXf100niaaJDX), 2) Dr. Jason Fung whose books "The Obesity Code" and "The Diabetes Code" have dominated Amazon.com bestsellers lists for years and are helping thousands lose weight and easily reverse type 2 diabetes by simply fasting and thus cutting out sugar and carbohydrates and other potential troublemakers..... and many many other doctors, they once believed the "mythology" that diseases like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, obesity and many others were primarily due to genetics, eating too much, perhaps not enough exercise, etc. (other causes except for diet). They were not part of some "conspiracy" or maliciously-negligently avoiding superior information. They simply believed the current myths and were parts of the 'echo chamber' and 'incentive structure' that sustains them.  Dr. Noakes mentions how he was one of the respectable doctors who without much thought dismissed people like the famed low-carb proponent Dr. Atkins as some contrarian-scammer, yet when other doctors he greatly respected defended Dr. Atkins he finally decided to read Atkins' classic book "Dr. Atkin's New Diet Revolution". Dr. Noakes mentions:

>"You must understand for 33 years I've been saying that you must eat a high carbohydrate diet and Atkins was the devil, I mean literally, that's what we thought of him....I went down to the bookshop, bought the book, brought it back and two hours later I was stunned, and I realized that I'd been wrong and that I'd been wrong for 33 years...During this period I've gone through a lot of trauma...I "came out" and said I am now a low-carbs-no-grain person and immediately lost all my funding, my research funding. The medical research council took [their money away from me"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rtZJF-xfyo)

Like that rare priest who might suddenly understand evolution and genetics and perhaps admit to losing faith and feel as though he had been espousing erroneous views-advice Noakes made a similar change. It is important to note that Noakes was part of the existing 'echo chamber' that would vilify-dismiss Dr. Atkins, and that once he changed his views, he would also become an outcast to the existing bureaucracy-Church. When Dr. Noakes was ignoring-vilifying Atkins, was he a "bad guy" who was part of some "conspiracy"?, Of course not. There ARE charlatans and people who are willfully negligent to various degrees if it helps them make money, and this is obviously the case in every field, ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY and competitionless governments!. Nearly the entire field of Bariatric surgery where people's stomachs are surgically shrunk can be seen as mostly negligence by doctors-priests since most people can easily be trained-taught how to simply fast as Dr. Fung's books have done for many. Yet such relatively barbaric, dangerous, and expensive practice continues. I doubt the doctors who perform such surgeries are giving away copies of Fung's books. Back to Noakes. 

Noakes might have equated Atkins with one of those medical charlatans. The popular and somewhat nebulous term 'Cognitive Dissonance' is at play here and plays an important role in the creation of the 'echo chambers' that unites groups. People just have various understandable reasons which have little to do with pure malice or fraud for neglecting or holding contradictory ideas. Sometimes we neglect ideas because we already think we are doing things based on the best available information. Who has the time to properly consider every possible criticism? And then of course there is a bias that motivates us to overlook-ignore ideas that can greatly invalidate our views, sense of purpose, harm our finances, and when these factors are sort of layered on top of others the resulting ideological differences can lead to dangerous extremes-fallacies-excommunications-burnings. This might lead many mainstream scientists (like Noakes had done) to mistakenly attack or neglect revolutionary scientists (Atkins) on the one hand, and it could also lead to having people or revolutionary scientists label mainstream science as some "conspiracy" that purposely fights change, when that too would be a mischaracterization. And hopefully one gets the point.

Just like we can expect more "charlatans" or non-believing priests in organized religion as the reasons to doubt become more and more numerous or obvious, so can we expect more medical professionals or scientists who purposely look the other way when superior ideas which go against entrenched dogmas become more noticeable. Those who are more intellectually rigorous and thus more willing to think independently instead of just uncritically accepting emerging trends and also willing to change their minds will do so sooner, and the more fraudulent and-or dangerously negligent or just intellectually lazier will do so slower, and much more so when they work in competition-immune governments and their regulatory bureaucracies like the CDC, FDA, NIAID. 

The fact that simply aggressive fasting and eating a low-carbohydrate diet for just a few weeks can essentially reverse-control type-2 diabetes for many, yet the mainstream medical establishment remains somewhat oblivious to this fact, is just further evidence of how ideological and incentive structures, especially when they are entrenched-sustained via government monopolies like the American Medical Association which essentially controls what is taught to doctors, are difficult and slow to change. Again, how many theologians are actively knocking on the doors of Biology departments? Why did it take 70+ years for Communism to be generally seen as a failure(and still exists in Cuba!)? Again, this should be obvious, the emergence of superior ideas means that all the "experts" of the past were wrong.

Once one understands how competition is what discovers superior information all one has to do is look where competition and its required freedom exists to see where the real 'state of the art' information resides. It is in Amazon.com, its bestsellers lists of competing books-ideas-'well-written reviews', and in youtube-internet where various scientists-intellectuals are debating and thus competing intellectually where one sees the emergence and spread of superior information. It is thus not surprising that the low-carb-keto-carnivore authors and personalities like Dr. Jason Fung dominate Amazon.com bestsellers lists, while mainstream "scientists"-theologians remain in their 'echo chambers' in the government-regulated bureaucracies-Church and related mythology of attempting to treat everything with a pill-vaccine-operation-intervention and increasingly 'technologically advanced treatments' which only addresses the eventual breakdowns in complex-biochemistry which are mostly the result of improper diets and environmental toxins. 

The story of Dr. Ancel Keys helps us further understand how out of the immense complexity of the biochemical order that creates the human body, coupled with human nature and perverse incentives, disastrous ideas can mislead the entire scientific community. In the 1950s Dr. Ancel Keys had a pet theory that saturated fats, which are the fat abundantly found in animals, were the major culprit in heart disease and that we would be better off eating the polyunsaturated fats of vegetable oils. A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation documentary summarizes:

>"But the theory needed proof. In one experiment Keys and colleagues studied thousands of patients at mental hospitals in Minnesota feeding one group a diet high in corn oil and another group got saturated fat. It was the largest clinical trial in history to test Ancel Keys' diet heart hypothesis but after years of research they didn't publish what they found....Why did they sit on the data? Because nothing happened. The results showed no health benefit from the high corn oil diet, it completely contradicted Ancel Keys' theory. Years passed, people kept on eating corn oil, but the whole story of the Minnesota coronary experiment has never been told until today now that a new team of scientists has recovered the data, re-evaluated it and discovered there was even evidence of harm from the [high corn oil diet."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO86iiTkPfo)

Best-selling author-physicist Gary Taubes had discussed why the results had been hidden-ignored with Keys' colleague Ivan Frantz and mentions:

>"He said that they were disappointed in the way the study had come out. And the implication was that... "they" was primarily Ancel Keys" 


"Scientists"-people (slightly smarter apes) looking for glory and overlooking information that contradicts their life's work or affects their finances is very much a part of human nature. Consider the following, [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685008/) of scientific misconduct estimates that about 2% (1.97%):

>"of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once –a serious form of misconduct by any standard– and up to 33.7% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12% (N = 12, 95% CI: 9.91–19.72) for falsification, and up to 72% for other questionable research practices...Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct." (Fanelli) 

Stop and read that again! So about one out of fifty scientists will admit to fabrications and falsifications at least once, a somewhat courageous admission we can expect few to make. But the less courageous admission regarding colleagues which we can expect more to admit to, reveals that a whopping 14.12%, or one in seven scientists, has purposely fabricated or falsified information. There are about 1 million doctors in the USA and 7 million scientists and engineers for a total of 8 million. 14.12% is a whopping 1.13 million scientists-docs who are out there maliciously or extremely negligently looking to exaggerate, lie, etc. to get government grants-influence-fame-money and so on, and another 5.76 million (72% of 8 million) who are aware of other scientists doing 'questionable research practices'. So year after year 1.13 million potential charlatans and-or exaggerators (see wikipedia ["List of scientific misconduct incidents"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scientific_misconduct_incidents)) are out there recognizing and affiliating with other fraudsters to various degrees, statistically guaranteeing that eventually somebody is going to hit it big and potentially mislead a large portion of the scientific community as in all likelihood happened with Ancel Keys and countless others. Are these statistics just applicable to scientists? Of course not! We can and should expect the same level of fraud and negligence across all industries like in economics and history as well. This helps us understand how 'echo chambers' of fraud, negligence, and ignorance form, persist, and are so slow to change. 

Just one example of someone who got caught is [Yoshitaka Fujii (Japan)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshitaka_Fujii), an anesthesiologist, who "was found to have fabricated data in at least 183 scientific papers, setting what is believed to be a record for the number of papers by a single author requiring retractions. A committee reviewing 212 papers published by Fujii over a span of 20 years found that 126 were entirely fabricated, with no scientific work done. Only 3 were found to be valid. He was also found to have forged the signatures of scientists he listed as co-authors without their knowledge". Diederik Stapel, professor of Social Psychology at Tilburg University and the University of Groningen, after getting busted wrote about his numerous data forgeries:

>"In the privacy of my office or my study at home, I did some things that were terrible, maybe even disgusting. I faked research data and invented studies that had never happened. I worked alone, knowing exactly what I was doing, and my solitary drive to achieve led to my becoming ever more detached from myself and my emotions. I didn’t feel anything: no disgust, no shame, [no regrets."](https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2019/07/16/fabrication-the-diederik-stapel-case/) (Bik)



Consider the story of Frances Oldham Kelsey, she was an FDA reviewer who in 1960 refused to authorize thalidomide given what she considered was lack of evidence of safety. Her wikipedia summarizes:

>"Even though it had already been approved in Canada and more than 20 European and African countries,she withheld approval for the drug and requested further studies. Despite pressure from thalidomide's manufacturer, Kelsey persisted in requesting additional information to explain an English study that documented peripheral neuritis, a nervous system side effect. She also requested data showing the drug was not harmful to the fetus.

>Kelsey's insistence that the drug should be fully tested prior to approval was vindicated when the births of deformed infants in Europe were linked to thalidomide ingestion by their mothers during pregnancy. Researchers discovered that the thalidomide crossed the placental barrier and caused serious birth defects. She was hailed on the front page of The Washington Post as a heroine for averting a similar tragedy in the U.S."

What if instead of her, one of the fraudulent-negligent scientists had been in her position? What if in today's American CDC or FDA or National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases or in the World Health Organization we have such potential bad-negligent apples-Lysenkos? 

It is now widely discussed how the scientific community has a “replication crisis” because around half of published research is so plagued with errors that only about half can be reproduced. Kelsey Piper summarizes:

">[One 2015 attempt](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716) to reproduce 100 psychology studies was able to replicate only 39 of them. [A big international](https://osf.io/ux3eh/) effort in 2018 to reproduce prominent studies found that 14 of the 28 replicated, and an [attempt to replicate studies from top journals Nature and Science](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0399-z.epdf?sharing_token=uY-7XXSwrYqjnTaF4k_LwdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0ODPoD_DniKOJV85YbvYREV4WYg3rUMkw4Dn3xQpiS36ewTQMztGsmzwDVhiD6qsOTincMm_6MNx3iVweaC-Br4IKcK_J1FMyo7gekrMG0IwJjMkUbPoOOsXV_plU0uyaUh7wihjHJ-UQu1bguEiZfqnqN7NTFPQt3C_0QoV-oKp432nRQ5ffc2UA5BY90g4iK0ZBBYY3dUcr_5QiA4dJ4hgldAHBXR-Z59rVmKtU6W1S9mmQWSK2UkVcSsp-mF6XUa0m236lCGYzIleP_2BSiM77pjx_WrxRWf5SrVCGJ5L535khtcNZ8XtAIl7bwr98I%3D&tracking_referrer=www.theatlantic.com) found that 13 of the 21 results looked at could be [reproduced."](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replication-crisis-peer-review-statistics)

It makes perfect sense that a field like psychology which has to deal with the complexity of the mind and human behaviour, is plagued by an even higher percentage of hypothetical bullshit.

We really want to understand how these patterns arise-repeat in *all complex fields*. In biochemistry, physics, economics, history, etc. We re-focus on economics.

The world of mainstream economics is similarly fooled by its misguided use of mathematical models. Math is good for physics-chemistry and relatively simple things. Per above, with enough computing power you can sorta guess how one ribosome might work for a few nanoseconds, but how 100 billion neurons in a human brain lead to actions based on prices and a global division of labor that has evolved over millennia and coordinates the actions of 8 billion people, is way too complex for math to be of significant value when it comes to analyzing the fundamentals. Since money, law, religions, governments, 'the market process' and resulting 'Social Organism' is the product of 'Natural Selection', they need to be studied more like biology than physics. As Menger explains:

>"Now if social phenomena and natural organisms exhibit analogies with respect to their nature, their origin, and their function, it is at once clear that this fact cannot remain without influence on the method of research in the field of the social sciences in general and economics in particular....Now if state, society, economy, etc., are conceived of as organisms, or as structures analogous to them, the notion of following directions of research in the realm of social phenomena similar to those followed in the realm of organic nature readily suggests itself." (Menger, 1996, p. 131)

But the slightly smarter apes just love their impressive looking useless mathematicobabble, and the sheer arrogance and sense of superiority that comes from being able to understand it helps evolve the 'Priesthood of Scientism'. Menger, peace be upon him, again:

>"I do not belong to the believers in the mathematical method as a way to deal with our science. I am of the opinion that mathematics is mainly a way to give an example or demonstration, but not to do the research itself...Mathematics is not a method for...economic research" [(Ebeling, 2012)](https://www.aier.org/article/carl-menger-and-the-sesquicentennial-founding-of-the-austrian-school/)


Mises sets those apes straight(re-quoted):

>"As a method of economic analysis econometrics is a childish play with figures that does not contribute anything to the elucidation of the problems of economic reality."

>"The Econometricians have not the slightest notion of the issues involved."

The distinction between micro and macro economics is another "delusion" or myth the apes have created because they don't understand how the economy or socioeconomic order, just like the biological one, must be understood as one intertwined, indivisible, and coevolved system. Hayek perfectly describes the evolving 'Priesthood of Scientism' and their math-based "magic" as he criticizes the:

>"...delusion that macro-economics is both viable and useful (a delusion encouraged by its extensive use of mathematics, which must always impress politicians lacking any mathematical education, and which is really the nearest thing to the practice of magic that occurs among professional economists)" (Hayek, 1989, p. 98)

And in a more general sense, the great scientist Nikola Tesla:

>"Today’s scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality."

Understandably so, the world of economics too has its mixture of relatively clueless economists and also some charlatans so the same applies. Here too, the naive thinkers portray central banks and the economists-priests that mismanage our economies as a "conspiracy" by "elites" which is greatly mistaken. For example, former Federal Reserve economist Danielle DiMartino Booth describes in her book “Fed Up: An Insider’s Take on Why the Federal Reserve is Bad for America”, how utterly clueless, incompetent, politicized, and disastrous the Federal Reserve and our mainstream economics establishment are. The important point here is that Danielle was herself a product of our mainstream economics establishment. She studied in our "great universities" and one could say she grew up with "faith" in the mathematical models-courses-theories(mythologies) she studied in college, but eventually realized that much of what she had learned was wrong similarly to how perhaps some religious priest comes to abandon some previously held beliefs-myths. In the introduction she writes:

>“I witnessed the tunnel vision and arrogance of Fed academics who can’t understand that their theoretical models bear little resemblance to real life…Every American must understand this extraordinary powerful institution and how it affects his or [her everyday life”](https://www.amazon.com/Fed-Up-Insiders-Federal-Reserve/dp/0735211655) (Booth, 2017, p. 10)

Had Danielle been familiar with Mises, Hayek, Hazlitt, Rothbard and other members of the so-called ‘Austrian School’ of economics, she would've had a superior understanding of economics and the inevitable disaster that the Federal Reserve is, but then her life would have been different and she would not have reached such heights at the FED. That would have been akin to having an evolutionary biologist try to move up the ranks of the Catholic Church. Her great insider-tell-all book is not the first of its kind to expose the dangerous disaster that the Federal Reserve and our mainstream economics establishment is. For example, William E. Simon, former Secretary of the Treasury for presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, fills us in on the incompetence of the nation’s “most prominent economists” during the financial crisis of the 70s. His statements apply just as well to recent (and future) economic troubles and government “experts”:

>“The Wall Street Journal interviewed several dozen of the most prominent economists in the United States on the causes of the recession and on ways to prevent a recurrence. They disagreed about virtually everything save this: that there was much economists did not yet understand. The details of the economists’ ignorance are of interest, but I stress here the overriding conclusion to be drawn from their statements: The economists who had been advising our Presidents simply had not known what they were doing…Gerson Green, formerly of the Office of Economic Opportunity, summed up the attitude of many of his colleagues when he observed caustically, “The change I discern is that none of us knows what to do. In those days, we thought we did. The country has taught the social engineers a lesson.”… So who was running the store? The answer is: nobody. Not one human being in the whole vast realm of political control over the American economy has ever known what he was doing. Nobody could know. This is the precise phenomenon described by F.A. Hayek in his Noble lecture called “The Pretense of Knowledge.” For forty years the American ship of state has been lunging erratically toward economic disaster, with no awareness of its direction…” (Simon, 1978, p. 121–123)

A final and perhaps best example showing how our mainstream economics establishment-FED is essentially based on mythology and not on "conspiracy" is the fact that one of today's best 'Austrian Economists', Robert Wenzel, editor & publisher of [EconomicPolicyJournal.com](http://EconomicPolicyJournal.com) was invited to give a [talk at the New York FED](https://mises.org/library/new-york-fed-leave-building). If the FED had been run by some secret cabal, the last thing they would have done is invite Mr. Wenzel who told them early in his speech:

>"to do what I believe should be done, which is to close down the entire Federal Reserve System."

Reflecting on being invited to give the speech and his experience talking to FED officials Wenzel wrote:

>"Overall, I was simply amazed at the lack of knowledge of these economists about the Austrian School. It was very close to nonexistent....My experience at the Fed points out the importance of intellectual debate and study. Clearly, the economists whom I met at the Fed were brought up in an intellectual tunnel, where they had no exposure to Austrian economic theory. They read and study within a limited range of writers. But they were very curious about my view."


The so-called military-industrial-complex is the same way where you have plenty of "good vs. evil" thinkers who genuinely believe we need to protect ourselves against the evildoers and that the world has and will always be about who can display more power, there are also plenty of armaments industry CEOs-salesman just looking to purposely exaggerate or even create threats to make a buck.  

So to briefly summarize, wherever there is complexity-doubt (nutrition-medicine-afterlife-economy-environment-climate-history-mind( psychiatry's popular 'chemical imbalance' myth which of course needs to be treated by mythical poisons-drugs is also myth-bullshit)), there is *mythology*. The economically clueless masses and politicians always believe that a coercive-competitionless-monopoly of "experts" in the government should manage-oversee-regulate related research and action since they have no clue how freedom and competition are best suited for all knowledge. And of course we also have that petri-dish of deliberately fraudulent scientists-doctors-engineers-politicians, and how can one forget, the 'foreign policy experts' that are constantly reminding us of all the evildoers trying to kill us.....all inadvertently-negligently-maliciously creating hypothetically dangerous scenarios, which then create a sort of ideological chain-reaction where government wealth and coercion spreads certain ideas which become more difficult to correct. Natural selection created a sort of algorithm to discover information, create superior social order, and also very importantly! prevent the growth of falsehoods and incentive structures which lead to hard-to-change-paralyzing-dangerous-mythological-tyrannical orders-bureaucracies. Freedom of course, which is "the ultimate algorithm". We just need to understand it, that's all. The average citizen has no need to become an expert in nutrition, or economics, or history, or psychology, or whatever, what he needs to become an expert in, which fortunately is not hard at all, is ensuring that there is maximum freedom and thus 'competitive knowledge discovery' everywhere. It does not look like we will be able to change the fact that we are simply slightly smarter apes, which I think is kind of cool anyways, however, we can easily go from "wild" to "civilized" slightly smarter apes by understanding how private property and emerging freedom and 'competitive knowledge discovery' is what leads to civilization. By focusing on economic education we really strike at the root of the ignorance and errors from which all other problems arise. 


When people who criticize mainstream bureaucracies like the medical-religious-economic-etc. on potential differences of opinion regarding diet, vaccines, handling of Covid, religious interpretation, economic policy and numerous other potential areas, it is a gigantic error to label such bureaucracies and whatever errors they might propagate as some sinister conspiracy. Unfortunately this error happens all the time among naive thinkers who erroneously think everything is the result of some plotters-conspirators when they are the result of more complex evolutionary factors-incentives and are to a significant degree "the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design". These are the "conspiracy theorists" who then sort of mess it up for the rest of the critics of such bureaucracies. These "conspiracy theorists" sooner or later always end up in the same misguided conclusions, blaming "The Jews", the Rockefellers, "the Devil", the Illuminati, etc. which then makes it easy and understandable for the misguided-malicious-negligent bureaucrats-experts to dismiss all criticism. However, just like we don't want to make the errors that the "conspiracy theorists" fall for, we also don't want to be ignorant of how human nature coupled with complexity-mythology, competition-less government monopolies and financial incentives create an 'incentive structure' and sort of "echo chamber" which fights change, selects for ass-kissing, negligence, etc. thus virtually guaranteeing that often times as you get to the upper layers of bureaucracies you have some real charlatans, truly malicious characters, and the dangerously misinformed and negligent. When truly malicious people are identified in such bureaucracies, then the "conspiracy theorists" will use that as evidence of some "grand conspiracy" which never really existed which helps the pattern repeat... Anyway, you get the point... We just want a nuanced understanding of all factors. And most importantly, to understand how freedom and resulting competitive knowledge discovery, not "science" or whatever that means, is the key to both discovering superior information and preventing bad ideas from persisting thanks to massive government regulatory-monopoly-coercive bureaucracies.
