##### Human Evolution and Nutrition.

A brief look at human evolution and nutrition is not only important for improving our health-fitness-happiness but also helps us solidify our complete evolutionary understanding of the world, and building on the above, we continue to see how the mainstream scientific community or Priesthood can be so wrong.


About 6.5 million years ago we shared a common ancestor with Chimpanzees and Bonobos and were herbivorous tree-dwellers where it was relatively safer, but eventually certain environmental pressures forced us to come down from the trees and become the ultimate carnivorous predators. Unlike herbivores which need more laborious-complex digestive systems to extract-create the necessary fats-proteins-calories from plants, carnivores move up in the food-chain by eating and easily absorbing such nutrients from the bodies of other animals that have already "done the work". What could possibly have the perfect combination of nutrients needed to build a human brain, kidney, liver, muscles, etc. than the brain, kidney, liver of a biologically similar mammal-animal(or human (cannibalism seems to have been popular in our past)). Our guts changed in important ways from those of our closely related primates. The small intestine which absorbs nutrients grew while the large intestines where bacteria helped break down, ferment, and extract-create nutrients from plants shrank. Bacteria that have evolved to feed or decompose plants are mal-adapted to doing the same on animals, this allows herbivores to have slightly acidic stomachs(pH around 4.0), but if you are a carnivore (pH 2-3) bacteria that have evolved the necessary biochemistry to decompose or feed on fellow animal cells can harm you thus the need for a more acidic (lower pH) stomach. Scavenging and eating rotting animals with large quantities of such bacteria requires even more acidic stomachs which is precisely what humans have (pH 1.1 - 1.5). Dr. Saladino writes:

>"2.5 million years ago, with the advent of stone tools and hunting, our ancestors' brains began to grow even more rapidly. In fact they doubled in size over the next 1 million years. Based on the fossil record, it appears we reached a maximum brain size of 1600cc about 40,000 years ago, and that our brains have shrunk slightly since...a significant change in the rate of growth of our ancestors' brains coincided with stone tools and hunting..." (Saladino, p. 5)

>"In order to determine the proportion of animal foods in the diets of our predecessors, we can examine the amount of δ15 nitrogen in their fossilized bones. By looking at levels of this isotope, researchers are able to infer where in the food chain animals reside by identifying their protein sources. Herbivores generally have δ15N levels of 3–7 percent, carnivores show levels of 6–12 percent, and omnivores display levels between these two. When samples from Neanderthal and early modern humans were analyzed, they demonstrated levels of 12 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively, even higher than that of other known carnivorous animals like hyena and wolves."(Saladino, p. 7)


The downward trend in brain size to about 1,400cc at present coincided with the extinction of megafauna and especially the rise of agriculture as previously discussed. Today we get about 70% of our calories from plants, we consume large quantities of highly refined carbohydrates like breads and pastas which cause unnatural and frequent spikes in blood-sugar-glucose and also lack the numerous vitamins and minerals in bioavailable forms that our bodies can actually use. The gasoline that powers our cars has carbon, so does broccoli, yet nobody pumps broccoli into their gas tank. Similarly, just because plants have various vitamins and minerals we need, it does not mean that our bodies will be able to properly absorb them. For example, the phytic acid in seeds "chelates[binds with] with minerals and metals, such as calcium, magnesium, zinc, and iron, forming insoluble salts that are not readily absorbed by animals or humans. In particular, it can severely impair availability of zinc and iron. Phytate can also complex with proteins and may thereby reduce digestibility or enzyme [activity."](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/phytic-acid). Not only do we lack the necessary digestive machinery to get the same nutrition from plants that we have evolved to easily get from animals, we also lack defenses against the numerous toxins plants have evolved to defend themselves against predators-herbivores-insects. Plants that did not evolve chemical defenses would have been naturally selected out of existence millions of years ago, thus all plants that exist today do so because they contain such defenses to various degrees. Lectins (damage the gut), glycoalkaloids (neurotoxins), oxalates (create crystals which damage host in numerous ways), phytic acid binds to nutrients and prevents their absorption and [there are many more.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgnnklDVhso) The image below summarizes various types of toxins.

The glycemic index is a measure of how quickly glucose levels in the blood rise after eating certain foods. Pre-agricultural man, with considerable risk, might find carbohydrate-rich honey from time to time which has an index score of 58, but he would never find, and much less eat several times per day throughout the year, something like a French baguette that has a score of 99, sugary drinks like Coke(63), Gatorade(78),spaghetti(58), white rice(89), Cornflakes(93), and the plethora of processed, grain-based foods that make up most of our calories today. The average American consumes over 150 pounds of sugar per year, high-fructose corn syrup, and many other things [like recently-invented-unnatural vegetable-seed oils](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_XDMdltRlY) which contain [high amounts of polyunsaturated fats whose chemical structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQmqVVmMB3k) our bodies(mitochondria) have simply not evolved to deal with in the abnormally high quantities being consumed, which when taken together creates a sort of biochemical chaos that eventually manifests itself in our various diseases and easily explains why humans have become the only obese and metabolically dysfunctional animal that is plagued by 'diseases of civilization' like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, dental caries, etc. Animals in the wild who eat their 'species appropriate' diet are rarely ever seen with these diseases and so were human beings prior to the emergence of our modern diets based on these man-made foods instead of the mostly animal-based diets that natural selection has crafted our biology to ideally use.


The bottom line is that like a car that runs with contaminated-improper gasoline and performs sub-optimally, or without coolant and the heat eventually causes some early breakdown somewhere, improper nutrition is likewise the main source of our diseases and relative obesity. The complex biochemical order that took natural selection billions of years to ideally craft, is breaking down prematurely in countless ways due to bad raw materials-diet and environmental toxins. 


Mankind is beginning to catch up to men like dentist Weston Price and anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson who in the early 20th century wrote about how cultures that had not adopted the "civilized" Western world's agriculture-grain-based-sugary-seed-oils-processed diets were relatively healthier. To examine the result of highly complex systems like the economy, you do not have to get lost in little details and hypotheticals, just like the night-time pictures of North-South Korea and a few simple comparisons show which order is superior, the same applies to the biochemical order. In his seminal book ["Nutrition and Physical Degeneration"](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200251h.html) Weston Price easily notices how tribal societies that had not adopted the white man's diets with our sugars-seed-oils-etc. were relatively free-immune of cavities-"affections" and obesity-etc. He summarizes:

>"A critical examination of these groups revealed a high immunity to many of our serious affections so long as they were sufficiently isolated from our modern civilization and living in accordance with the nutritional programs which were directed by the accumulated wisdom of the group. In every instance where individuals of the same racial stocks who had lost this isolation and who had adopted the foods and food habits of our modern civilization were examined, there was an early loss of the high immunity characteristics of the isolated group. These studies have included a chemical analysis of foods of the isolated groups and also of the displacing foods of our modern civilization."

He noticed that not just tooth decay was a result of the white man's diet but also other ailments:

>"There have been many important unexpected developments in these investigations. While a primary quest was to find the cause of tooth decay which was established quite readily as being controlled directly by nutrition, it rapidly became apparent that a chain of disturbances developed in these various primitive racial stocks starting even in the first generation after the adoption of the modernized diet and rapidly increased in severity with expressions quite constantly like the characteristic degenerative processes of our modern civilization of America and Europe. While tooth decay has proved to be almost entirely a matter of the nutrition of the individual at the time and prior to the activity of that disease, a group of affections have expressed themselves in physical form."

It was easy to see over and over that soon after the wrong gasoline-food was given to people they soon began having cavities and other breakdowns-diseases. The arrogance of the civilized white man would ignore the dietary wisdom that such tribal societies contained. Wisdom that by now we can easily recognize was not the result of a superior understanding of biochemistry by tribal peoples, but arose via cultural-hayekian evolution. Price writes:

>"Much ancient wisdom, however, has been rejected because of prejudice against the wisdom of so-called savages. Some readers may experience this reaction to the primitive wisdom recorded in these chapters....since our orthodox theories have not saved us we may have to readjust them to bring them into harmony with Nature's laws. Nature must be obeyed, not orthodoxy. Apparently many primitive races have understood her language better than have our modernized groups. "

Stefansson spent years living with Eskimos who hardly ever ate any plants or carbohydrates or vegetable oils like our pre-agriculture ancestors and were in excellent health, free of cavities or various deficiencies we are supposed to be susceptible to by not eating plants. Stefansson succinctly describes human evolution and how the relatively sudden change to grain-based diets brought about by agriculture is a potential main source of our troubles. We also pay him homage by quoting him at length :

>"Practically the whole world is now agricultural in its diet... if the speculative study of our forebears is begun at the stage when they first deserve the name of anthropoid, or Ape-Human, their dietetic history will fall into three main stages— gathering, hunting, and farming. According to the geologists, the gathering stage, or apeman period, lasted several million years. During this time man ate roots and tubers, shoots and succulent leaves, fruits and yams and nuts, worms and snails and rodents, eggs and fledgling birds. This period was long enough for us to become well adapted to digesting and assimilating the diet, to be healthy on it... After the largely vegetarian gathering stage came the hunting stage, during which the ape turned definitely human. This will have lasted between one and three million years. The period was long enough to enable digestion and assimilation to adapt themselves to a largely carnivorous diet...The third or agricultural stage of diet marks a profound change from either of the two previous diets, those of the gathering ape and of the hunting or herding man. For hitherto, as exclusive gatherers in the anthropoid stage and as occasional gatherers in the hunting stage, men cannot have had any high percentage of cereal food. A little gathering of wild rice or wild wheat now and then, by small groups here and there, cannot have given the people of ten or twenty thousand years ago much evolutionary preparation for the drastic change that came in when our recent ancestors, in some such place as Egypt, India or China, discovered that they could support great numbers on small areas by planting crops— which, in practice, were chiefly cereals, at least over great stretches of several continents. Ten or even twenty thousand years is a short spell, in terms of biologic evolution. So the human mechanism for digesting and assimilating must still be much like what it was when agriculture thrust upon the human race a change in diet that was nearly as profound as the one which had been forced on the anthropoid long ago when he faced the choice of hunting or perishing... It is practically the anthropologists alone, the students of pre-history and of modern primitives, who seem aware that broad conditions of health, as influenced by food, were ever fundamentally different from what they now are. For most branches of the sciences which deal with health never have been jolted from a nearly unquestioning acceptance of the predominantly agricultural civilization into which we were born and in which we and our neighbors, and nearly all the people we ever heard of, have lived. On the agricultural diets now taken for granted this nation, like most or all other civilized nations, is having a deal of trouble with malnutrition... Such troubles have been with us since agriculture began." (Stefansson, p. 10-11)

He rightly ridicules-criticizes the dental establishment-experts of his day (1946) and even more so ours:

>"A clean tooth never decays. Brush your teeth after every meal, and visit your dentist twice a year. These slogans carry the faith of our people. It is said and believed that we have the best dentists in the world, that we have more tooth brushes, and use them more, than any other people. Many agencies, from kindergarten to university, from town council to and through the governments of city, state, and nation, strive for the spread of dental knowledge and the enforcement of its discipline... During the same time the ether was filled and the magazine pages were crowded with advertising which told that mouth chemistry is altered by a paste, a powder, or a gargle so as to prevent decay; that a special kind of toothbrush reaches all the crevices; that a particular brand of fruit, milk, or bread is rich in elements for tooth health. There were toothbrush drills in the schools. Mothers throughout the land were scolding, coaxing, and bribing to get children to use the preparations, eat the foods, and follow the rules that were said to guarantee perfect oral hygiene. There was endless repetition of the slogan: A clean tooth never decays. Meantime there appeared a statement from Dr. Adelbert Fernald, Curator of the Museum of the Dental School, Harvard University, that he had been collecting mouth casts of living North Americans of all racial derivations from blond to black, from the most northerly Eskimos through Canada and the States south to Yucatan. The best teeth and the healthiest mouths were found among people who never drank milk since they ceased to be suckling babes and who never in their lives tasted or tested any of the other things which we usually recommend for sound teeth. These people, Eskimos not as yet influenced by white men, never used tooth paste, tooth powder, toothbrushes, mouth wash, or gargle. They never took any pains to cleanse their teeth or mouths. They did not visit their dentists twice a year or even once in a lifetime. Their food was exclusively meat. Meat, be it noted, is not mentioned as good for the teeth in the advertisement sponsored by the Commissioner of Health of the City of New York. Teeth superior on the average to those of the presidents of our largest tooth paste companies are found in the world today, and have existed during past ages, among people who violate every precept of current dentifrice advertising." ([(Stefansson, p. 90-91))](https://www.amazon.com/Not-bread-alone-Eating-Healthy-ebook/dp/B01M7468KW/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=not+by+bread+alone&qid=1587179074&sr=8-6))


But there was just no-way that the arrogant "white man" slightly smarter apes could swallow the fact that these seemingly backward people, following inherited traditions that had been crafted by trial-error-evolution, could be wiser than their "science".  Again, just like organized religion is not necessarily motivated to constantly discuss its myths-ideas with Richard Dawkins, neither is the "scientific" medical community motivated to look at the aforementioned since most of its source of funding-prestige would disappear if most of our diseases could be prevented just eating better. Yet, again, this civilization-wide error is not a conspiracy-hoax it is "indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design".

Just like we are hopefully realizing that the best we can do for our health is to ensure that the food we eat and surrounding environment is as biologically ideal to match our complex biochemistry we also want to understand how we are damaging the environment via our pesticides, large monocrops, etc. Before we started clearing land and filling it with pesticides to unnaturally grow a bunch of corn and other crops, the natural world was full of animals whose grazing, pooping, peeing, was an integral part of the ecosystem we are destroying. We should aim to restore this delicate balance which would be better for our health and that of the biosphere as well. [The book "Sacred Cow" does a great job showing this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4gBgrzytUs)

It is unfortunate yet understandable to see how mankind, in other words, slightly smarter apes, are using their "reason" and "technology" to create fake meats-foods that will NOT come close to matching the immensely complex biochemistry needed to properly match what our biochemistry-enzymes have evolved to deal with over millions of years. The apes with electron microscopes are going wild destroying the social order via their monkey-central plans, and via disastrous interventions into the biochemical order and environment as well.
