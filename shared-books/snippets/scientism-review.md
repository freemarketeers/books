So natural selection created a sort of algorithm to discover information, create superior social order, and also very importantly! prevent the growth of falsehoods and incentive structures which lead to hard-to-change-paralyzing-dangerous-tyrannical orders-bureaucracies-Coronumism. Freedom of course, which is "the ultimate algorithm", and the "competitive knowledge discovery" that emerges from it. We just need to understand it, that's all. The average citizen has no need to become an expert in nutrition, or economics, or history, or psychology, or whatever, what he needs to become an expert in, which fortunately is not hard at all, is ensuring that there is maximum freedom and thus competitive knowledge discovery everywhere. It does not look like we will be able to change the fact that we are simply slightly smarter apes, which I think is kind of cool anyways, however, we can easily go from "wild" to "civilized" slightly smarter apes by understanding how private property and freedom and competition is what leads to civilization. By focusing on economic education we really strike at the root of the ignorance and errors from which all other problems arise.


If we look at the current state of the world we just had the run-away Coromunism with countless petty bureaucrats-mini-Lenins, destroying local economies and lives in numerous ways with many citizens encouraging such callous actions. For example on Dec. 31st 2020 a man went to a gym he was not a member of and demanded that the mask mandate was properly enforced and pulled out a gun on management when [they refused him entry.](https://www.fox9.com/news/charges-man-pulls-gun-on-manager-after-seeing-maskless-patrons-in-maplewood-gym?fbclid=IwAR0_fSrU5rzINriQqeqzr8K2JPsL5r9N2tSuDGtH73ksLKRzZD8FB3_VP_A) This is yet another example of how myths are sustained by the violence of believers instead of a 'conspiracy by elites'.

In our tribal zero-sum past that shaped our instincts, often times your gain came at the expense of others. Sadly controlling others, tyranny, seeing others do worse than us is often times a source of pleasure, the Germans have a word for this "schadenfreude". The economically ignorant slightly smarter apes are really going wild, reverting to their instinctual hatreds and barbarism. Essentially a repeat of the jealous, hateful, economically ignorant incentives that led to Lenin's Bolshevik revolution and world-wide spread of Communism.

In virtually all complex fields, climate-medicine-economy-mind-nutrition-history the slightly smarter apes' ignorance of how freedom and competition is what truly discovers superior information-order has them growing government-'central planning' to essentially sacrifice virgins. Actually it is a lot worse. Sacrificing a virgin is not as bad as filling the planet with nukes, it does not shutdown the world economy or coercively inject billions of people with what are essentially mythical dangerous potions(at least the CovidVaccines). Coming up with increasingly 'advanced treatments' for cancer-diabetes and our numerous nutrition-related diseases is also on-par with sacrificing virgins. And just like the religious authorities of the past, we too are suppressing dissent.

I know it can seem hard to not see much of the disastrous global central planning as 'conspiracies', but once again consider CovidMania lockdowns. During the latter half of 2022, when most of the world had abandoned the lockdowns, China, like a dog chasing its tail, went wild with idiotic draconian lockdowns. Was this the result of "Big Pharma" and Bill Gates and the WHO just trying to sell more vaccines or some nefarious purpose? Of course not, it is just the fact that the Chinese have a massive bureucracy of "scientists" and simple-minded bureucrats who went along with some idiotic "Zero-Covid" policy and just kept mutilating their populations no different than how Lenin did with his idiotic ideas. 


How do we get out of this mess? It was already bad enough before CovidMania! Per book's introduction, we find ourselves in Salem, Massachusetts in the 1600s telling the dangerous slightly smarter apes and the "experts" of their day that a few million years ago we had a common ancestor with apes. How could we possibly get so many to realize they have been so wrong? Hopefully without getting killed too. We just have to do what Ludwig von Mises and friends told us to do and already did for us in the early 20th century.
