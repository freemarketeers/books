### Complexity leads to Mythology


Wherever there is complexity, the slightly smarter apes understandably fool themselves with mythology and coercive-competition-less government structures leading to the retardation of superior 'competitive knowledge discovery', tyranny for those who don't want to go along or fund the government propagated myths, or also wars in the cases when via government coercion the apes attack each other. In the next major section we will discuss various myths more or less in the order in which they arose and they can be divided into two parts, myths arising out of biochemical complexity leading to errors regarding nutrition, medicine, vaccines, covid, etc., and myths relating to history or ideology which is vital for understanding how the apes brainwash themselves into wars and have the planet littered with nuclear weapons and more.
