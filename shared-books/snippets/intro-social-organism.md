Just like the human body-organism and the numerous "systems" that coordinate it like the respiratory-nervous-digestive "systems", are the result of the actions of some 70 trillion human and bacterial cells but obviously NOT the result of any conscious planning or designing by them, and thanks to the likes of Darwin and a modern understanding of genetics we can understand how 'natural selection' was the inadvertent "designer" of such systems and complex order, the modern global socioeconomic order-'Social Organism', is also coordinated by a "system", by what economists of the so-called 'Austrian School' like Ludwig von Mises and his great protégé F.A. Hayek, referred to as "The Market Process". 'The Market Process' and the "parts" it is composed of like money, prices, economic competition, interest rates, and the legal-religious-governmental frameworks that sustain it, "are indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design" [(Adam Ferguson)](https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/adam-fergusons-great-insight) similar to how cells inadvertently-unconsciously act to create the systems that coordinate multicellular life. The 'market process' shares this trait with language which is also a complex mechanism that is the result of human action but was not consciously designed or invented by people-cells. It took about one billion years for natural selection to evolve the numerous complex biochemical 'systems' that allow single cells to cooperate leading to multicellular animals. Sometimes these mechanisms fail and the cells revert to their solitary ways and replicate wildly, in other words, they become cancerous-tribal or uncooperative and prematurely destroy the larger multicellular organism-order they were a part of. Similarly, it took about 50,000 years for natural selection to evolve 'the market process' which reordered tribal homo sapiens into cooperative members of the 'Social Organism'. Unfortunately, the economically ignorant tribal slightly smarter apes intuitively turn cancerous when they destroy 'the market process' via coercive central planning-Socialism because it inadvertently destroys-diminishes the freedom of individuals which is vital for the functioning of the 'Social Organism'.
