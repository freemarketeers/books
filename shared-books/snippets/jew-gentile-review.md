#### Jew-Gentile review and where we are today in June 2023.

So we got natural selection selecting for order and eventually the very mechanisms like genetics and 'the market process' which create the biological and socioeconomic orders respectively. The latter inadvertently arose as homo sapiens respected private property more and more, which encouraged more pie-and-order-increasing-trade as opposed to violence, turned brains into CPUs in a global world-wide distributed supercomputer which is constantly innovating and spreading information via 'economic competition'. The 'software', in other words, the identities-culture-laws that homo sapiens absorbed leading to this chain-reaction of freedom and emerging 'competitive knowledge discovery' and thus civilization got a massive boost when things like monotheism and 'The Ten Commandments' arose. As already briefly discussed, 'Jewish Identity' has *inadvertently* helped civilization via pro-freedom-capitalism attitudes-myths, the defense of the freedom of minorities and individuals since they are understandably usually a minority, and many other ways. But, again, as Churchill so wisely noticed, 'Jewish Identity' has also *inadvertently* spread disastrous myths like Communism and Zionism leading to polarizations that led to World War Two, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and now the Russia-Ukraine World War. We need a Zionist Gorbachev asap that can somewhat admit to error and help bring reform. The Muslim world also needs a Gorbachev, one that can significantly change the tone of its general criticism of Zionism to be one without conspiratorial malice and more based on misunderstandings. 

One of the few relatively wise mainstream voices criticizing  the accelerating collapse of the USA via both the CovidMania coercive 'Priesthood of Scientism', as well as the Zionized 'Foreign Policy Priesthood' pushing for the tribalistic Neocon Russia-Ukraine war was Fox news political commentator Tucker Carlson who was abruptly "cancelled" or "deplatformed" in April 2023. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League and thus the ideal representative of today's 'Jewish Identity' tweeted:

<img src="../../images/greenblatt-tucker.jpg" alt="Greenblatt on Tucker"
	title="Greenblatt on Tucker" width="550" height="200" />

Never mind that Carlson is a fellow homo sapiens, has a degree in History, has read countless books, is a father and family man, has educated millions via his journalism. Nah, he spews 'antisemitic, racist, xenophobic and anti-LGBTQ hate to millions.'

Unfortunately Tucker himself and much of America lacks the necessary nuanced understanding needed to really make sense of the world and understandably falls for the usual 'good vs. evil' arguments, blaming our increasing chaos on "some larger force acting upon us", which sadly some will blame on a 'conspiracy by Jews' given the understandable misunderstandings and resulting enmity as Greenblatt's comments clearly show. Tucker mentions in one of his last speeches before being laid off:

>"....none of this makes sense in conventional political terms. When people or crowds of people or the largest crowd of people at all which is the federal government the largest human organization in human history decide that the goal is to destroy things. Destruction for its own sake...What you're watching is not a political movement, it's evil..... if you want to know what's evil and what's good what are the characteristics of those....Good is characterized by order, calmness, tranquility, peace, whatever you want to call it, lack of conflict...And evil is characterized by their opposites, violence, hate, disorder, division, disorganization and filth, so if you are all in on the things that produce the latter basket of outcomes, what you're really advocating for is evil. That's just true. I'm not calling for a religious war, far from it, I'm merely calling for an acknowledgment of what we're watching..... Let's have a debate about our ideas, they don't want a debate... Those are manifestations of some larger force acting upon us, it's just so obvious, [it's completely obvious."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32UPXGChgo)


Regarding the Zionist-Neocons, who continue to polarize the planet in their quixotic fight against antisemitism, the great Ron Paul who has a superb laser-like focus on how the Zionist-Neocons spread their dangerous ideology and wars mentions: 

>"...a lot of them don't seem to be totally evil... I think a lot of them are very naive and well intentioned....but the people who really run the show, you know, the Paul Wolfowitzs of the world, the Neocon leaders...like a Dick Chaney...[I think they're evil."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY9EXX-fP98)

Ouch! No! "They" are NOT evil! They are fellow homo sapiens in their culturally evolved 'echo chambers' following their ideologies and myths. In an interview with Iran TV Ron Paul mentioned:

"....the tragedy of Gaza.... To me I look at it like a concentration camp. And people are making home-made bombs, and [like] they are the aggressors?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1t4O9CcZQ0)

Ouch! Gaza can easily be seen by one side as a 'concentration camp' but this view implies that a moral choice between who is good (Palestinians and Hamas who make the bombs) and bad (Israelis who create the 'concentration camp') has been made when in reality moral judgements are not the way to untangle the complex evolutionary factors that have us where we are. Again, it does not matter how horrible the actions of fellow homo sapiens may be, we have to focus on the complex ideas and circumstances that lead them to act the way they do.

Unfortunately, and yet again for reasons no one is to blame, just like the traumatized Jews see antisemitism everywhere and with immense understandable ignorance, negligence and oftentimes viciously and cruelly leave immense destruction and misery on their wake, many Muslims, especially those in places like Gaza, are also traumatized and have an immense hatred of Jews and fall for all the naive antisemitic tropes which then of course motivates the Zionists-Jews and their supporters to see the world the way they do and the chicken came before the egg etc. What a mess! In websites like 'Palestinian Media Watch'[(palwatch.org)](https://palwatch.org/) Jews constantly monitor the seemingly never-ending stream of hate towards Jews that one finds in Palestinian media. Just one quick look with some recent headlines shows:

>"Mahmoud Al-Tamimi, father of 19-year-old terrorist “Martyr”:  
>“Qusai completed the matriculation exams last year [2021], and he worked for some time in a restaurant in Ramallah. He was beloved in the village, and he never aspired to have a car or to have a home, or to prepare himself for the future. He aspired to Martyrdom, and indeed he achieved it.” 

>[Official PA daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, Oct. 26, 2022] "

Videos like this one ['The Child-Martyrdom cult of the Palestinian Authority'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3-zENpAF-U) show clips from Palestinian TV showing kids being raised for martyrdom saying awful things, etc.

Also, reflective of the chaos we are seeing in May 2023:

>"Senior Islamic Jihad official Khalil Al-Bahtini: “What we were educated on, and [what] our culture is, is that whoever lives on this land and does not merit Martyrdom, he has lost out. Allah has honored us in this land with Ribat (i.e., religious conflict over land claimed to be Islamic) and Jihad, and we have no role in this blessed land other than Jihad.It is our honor, all the honor, that we are fighting against Israel, this thieving entity, and that we are educating our sons to hate this entity.It is our honor that we are continuing with all our days, efforts, and intentions to blow up all of this Zionist entity’s cities. Thus we will record in history that the resistance fighters of Palestine, and the resistance fighters of the Gaza Strip, were like a thorn in the throat of this entity, and that they did not negotiate and did not renounce a [single] grain of soil of this land.”

>[Fatah Movement – Bethlehem Branch, Telegram [channel, May 9, 2023]" https://palwatch.org/page/33094  ](https://palwatch.org/page/33094)


The fellow homo sapiens who have absorbed a 'Jewish Identity' watch this and it is obvious to them that they are good and these people are evil, and thus as with Communist fallacies, the naive ideas and inevitable polarizations spread, providing the subtle but powerful swimmer's kick that inadvertently and “indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design” keeps polarizing mankind towards the final calamity. 

To the current crop of economically ignorant American and European ideological leaders, the current atheistic 'Priesthood of Scientism', and the increasing millions of government-connected corporations and socialist-minded-do-gooders, the views of white Christians like Tucker and Paul talking about "evil" are as enthusiastically discarded as they were in 1918 by Lenin and his "experts". The patterns just repeat. And remember the great Charles Lindbergh? We re-quote:   

>"It is not difficult to understand why Jewish people desire the overthrow of Nazi Germany. The persecution they suffered in Germany would be sufficient to make bitter enemies of any race. No person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution of the Jewish race in Germany. But no person of honesty and vision can look on their pro-war policy here today without seeing the dangers involved in such a policy both for us and for them. Instead of agitating for war, the Jewish groups in this country should be opposing it in every possible way for they will be among the first to feel its consequences."

Again, can you see the pattern repeat? Tucker, by arguing for peace and away from the tribalistic march to World War, is simply a traitor to 'the forces of good' trying to eradicate 'the forces of evil' (the antisemites and their friends). Soon after Tucker's firing, a senior Department of Defense official mentioned: “We’re a better country without him bagging on our military every night in front of hundreds of thousands of [people,”](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/25/pentagon-officials-cheer-tucker-carlson-ouster-00093819) . The simplistic-tribalistic with-us-or-against-us just intensifies.

Again, Mises tells us:

>"History speaks only to those people who know how to interpret it on the ground of correct theories."

Thus without the wisdom of Menger and his descendants, the emergence of our history and workings of the present remain relatively unknown as we march towards the final calamity. 

The mainstream 'Political Left' treats the Zionists as malicious white settler colonialists and capitalist exploiters which is a naive monumental error. Although movements like Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) have brought some much needed attention to the Palestinians, the vilifying character of the movement is mistaken and inadvertently does immense harm. Again, as with Communism, communist ideologues were not malicious or "evil" even if some very bad apples could easily be found in the massive coercive bureaucracies. One has to understand and sympathize with how the Zionists (also Communists) fooled themselves, oftentimes with the best intentions, into their respective myths, without vilification! Our previous Mises quote applies here again :

>"The problems involved are purely intellectual and must be dealt with as such. It is disastrous to shift them to the moral sphere and to dispose of supporters of opposite ideologies by calling them villains. It is vain to insist that what we are aiming at is good and what our adversaries want is bad. The question to be solved is precisely what is to be considered as good and what as bad. The rigid dogmatism peculiar to religious groups and to Marxism results only in irreconcilable conflict. It condemns beforehand all dissenters as evildoers, it calls into question their good faith, it asks them to surrender unconditionally. No social cooperation is possible where such an attitude prevails."

The constant moral pontification-vilification is doing immense harm! We need a careful and blame-free analysis of the situation and a solution.

Then there are tons of naive 'antisemites' accusing 'the Jews' of 'plotting' all kinds of things. It is actually the intellectual errors of the naive antisemites which then gives immense support to the Jews-Zionists. The reason why Jews in America who are just 2.3% of the population, and in Europe where they are just 0.2%, have so much influence and "power", has little to do with some 'sinister conspiracy' but with the understandable immense sympathy they get from the masses reacting to the naive antisemites. Again, this is what pushed 'Jewish Identity' and the Western world towards war with Hitler, and is again *inadvertently* taking America towards war with Putin and also China.

The Jew-Gentile intellectual errors and inevitable polarizations have of course dominated the US government's foreign policy views-ideology for decades leading to the continuous impoverishing military interventions in the Middle East like Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, Syria, etc. But the increasing polarizations just continue to expand and now shape not just the USA's foreign policy, but the entire US economy and its alleged future. For example on May 4th, 2023 the 'National Security Advisor' Zionist Jew Jake Sullivan gave a speech explaining how he and his experts are going to be the central planners of the USA in countless ways. The fact that this grandiose speech about the planning and future of the entire US economy was given, not by an economist, but by a Zionist Jew involved in 'National Security' is already very telling. We quote and comment at length:

>"Under the leadership of the president[Biden]..."

First, president Biden is obviously a senile and economically ignorant man who due to complex factors we've tried to show finds himself surrounded by the 'good vs. evil' Zionist Jews like Sullivan who now are the main ideological drivers of most of the US government. Jake continues:  

>"...we're seizing this moment to help set the rules that shape the Strategic environment and advance the values and norms that will define the world we want to live in."

The above central-planning language is indistinguishable from anything Lenin, Mao and similar economically clueless apes have said in the past regarding how "we" must coerce from the top-down. He further clarifies:

>"A hallmark of this approach has been the integration of foreign policy and domestic policy... So we're pursuing a modern industrial and innovation strategy to invest in our economic strength and technological edge here in the United States,"

The 'foreign policy' just means the continued destruction and weakening of governments critical of Zionism (most of the Muslim world) and-or their friends like Russia and China. The unfortunate fact that many of these governments have autocratic governments and some politicians who may say antisemitic things easily fools the Zionists and clueless masses that they are 'the good guys' and thus the militarization and warmongering in the Middle East is needed. And a government influenced 'modern industrial and innovation strategy to invest' is pure disastrous central planning. 

>"and over the course of the past two years we have delivered and and mostly we have delivered in a fundamentally bipartisan way. In 2021 the president signed the bipartisan infrastructure law, a generational investment in U.S infrastructure that sets a foundation for stronger and more durable growth, with all kinds of attended benefits to our national security."

More socialist central planning, massive transfers of wealth from the competitive and innovative private sector to competition-immune government-connected companies which will rebuild a few bridges adding little wealth to society compared to what will be consumed thus further damaging the social order and prosperity. Notice the 'benefits to our national security', it is all about us vs. them. 

>"We passed the 'chips and science act' which positions the United States to compete in manufacturing today and to lead the industries of tomorrow from artificial intelligence to Quantum Computing to nanotechnology"

Just more of the same. More transfers of wealth from the private sector where wealth is constantly paired with the companies that are really innovating and copying each other's innovations based on what billions of brains trade for to government-politically-connected entities that will just squander most of the wealth retarding progress. Notice how the IT sector, which is one of the few where American companies are still leaders, is a sector that evolved in the USA thanks to nearly 0 involvement by the government thus 100% real 'competitive knowledge discovery'. The Soviet Union had the Gosbank with which to create money to centrally transfer wealth to its various "experts" and bureaucracies, and we just do the same with the Federal Reserve with ultimately similar inferior results. Jake appears to have little clue what 'compete' really means and 'lead the industries of tomorrow' is more priestly mythical central planning-speak.

>"...we've also passed the inflation reduction act a historic law that is the largest investment ever anywhere in the world in history in Clean Energy Technologies positioning the United States to lead in both confronting the climate crisis and managing the energy transition."

Obviously the "inflation" is just a result of the US government needing to create trillions of dollars at an accelerating rate to sustain the current order with our 1.2+ trillion in military consumption and all kinds of socialist-inspired government coordinated transfers of wealth. ‘largest investment’ is more confiscation of wealth from the productive and order-creating private sector to government-connected wealth-destroying entities. The climate crisis is just a myth that continuously expands because more government-provided wealth goes to it thus incentivizing the growth of the myths. Beginning at around 21:20 he mentions:

>"...the United States will proactively deter threats, defend our people and our interests, and support the defense of our partners in the region period full stop. I mentioned our deterrence posture in Iraq and the same principle applies throughout the region where we have maintained a military presence together with coalition and regional partners designed to keep the peace in Syria."

More of the never-ending militarism needed to keep destroying the growth of anti-Zionist government structures that inevitably arise simply due to the fact that Zionism, as it currently exists, as with Communism, is a fallacy that can only lead to chaos and tyranny. Any amount of significant intellectual freedom in the world, especially the Islamic world, leads to a 'competitive knowledge discovery' that shows Zionism, again, as it currently functions with the current Israeli government, to be an error, thus the anti-Zionist sentiment just keeps emerging, unfortunately spreading naive antisemitism, and the reaction by the US-Israel-Zionists and 'good vs. evil' polarizations that must eventually lead to world war.

Are the likes of Greenblatt, Jake Sullivan and the Zionist Neocons part of some sinister conspiracy? Of course not! Of course not! Again, these are understandable reactions to naive antisemitic fallacies that trace their origin to complex evolutionary factors for which no one is to blame! On the very same day (May 4th) Jake gave his speech above highlighting what is essentially 'Socialism with Zionist Characteristics', Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi visited Syria and met with leaders from Hamas and other hard-core Islamic anti-Zionist groups and was quoted as saying:

>"Today more than ever, the unity and cohesion of the resistance forces, the region and the Islamic world is necessary to accelerate the defeat of the Zionist regime and the liberation of the holy Quds and the sovereignty of the Palestinians over their destiny,”....“We consider the collapse of the Zionist regime, whose effects are visible, to be [very close.” (Times of Israel)](https://www.timesofisrael.com/irans-raisi-meets-with-top-hamas-and-islamic-jihad-officials-urges-israels-defeat/)

Sadly the Iranians and various Islamic groups are treating the Zionists not as understandably misguided people, but as malicious-evil etc. The patterns repeat, so the polarizations continue.

Unlike the white American Christians whose Christianity and identity has been 'Zionised' as discussed above, the Chinese have a much easier time understanding the Muslim world and thus understandably have far more cordial relations with Iran and other harsh critics of Zionism, which of course makes them evil in the eyes of many Israelis and their American Christian backers as well. The Chinese and Russians have realized the monumental benefit that the US has had for generations by having the dollar be the 'reserve currency' of the world which has allowed the US to just acquire massive quantities of wealth from the rest of the world by just creating money. This has played a vital role in helping the US finance its 1.2 trillion dollar military and thus the disastrous never-ending battle against evil. The Chinese have recently gotten the Iranians and Saudis to get along much better, helping bring unity in the Muslim world, which can only mean further unity in their never-ending criticism of the Zionist fallacy. As of May 2023 the violence just continues to escalate with anti-Zionist groups like Hamas and 'Palestinian Islamic Jihad' (PIJ) launching their rockets into Israel and the retributions leading to the killing of leading anti-Zionist leaders and resulting world-wide polarizations. China, with Russian support, tried to pass a United Nations 'Security Council' joint statement regarding the escalating violence, but the US blocked it because Israelis felt like the statement would show a sort of moral equivalence between the Israelis and the organization (PIJ) which launched the rockets. To the Zionists there can be no moral equivalency, this inadvertently strikes at the root of Zionist identity and mythology, the uniqueness of the Jews, how they are 'the canary in the coalmine', how the non-Jewish world has been antisemitic and evil towards them culminating in the Holocaust. The entire plethora of myths and intellectual fallacies understandably makes it more difficult for them to accept any sort of moral equivalence. It is oh so easy for them to see their 'civilized' white European Ashkenazi Jews, and their countless Nobel Laureates, and point the finger at the distraught people in Gaza spewing immense hatred of Jews to easily conclude they are the good and civilized ones. Again, it was obvious to countless atheistic Soviet  scientists that the myth-following religious Americans were wrong. But, yet again, no one is to blame. It is easy to paint the distraught Palestinians as uncivilized extremists, it is easy to see the businessmen as malicious exploiters profiting at the 'expense of others', it is much harder to understand the much more complex circumstances that lead to such hatreds. Somehow we need to create an intellectual beacon of Jews and Non-Jews who can then lead the rest to prosperity.


Israelis are also right when they criticize many attempted international organization's statements against them when such statements treat the Israelis as 'the bad guys'. For example, regarding the current violence in May 2023, from egypttoday.com we read:

>"The Arab League Council has urged the International Criminal Court (ICC) to complete its probe into the war crimes and crimes against humanity that Israeli has committed against the defenseless [Palestinian people."](https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/124285/Arab-League-Council-urges-ICC-to-complete-probe-into-Israeli)


On May 15th Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas told the United Nations that Israel should be suspended from the United Nations if it does not allow a Palestinian state and the right of millions of refugees to return to the lands their ancestors were expelled from in 1948. He mentions:

>"Britain and the United States, in particular, bear direct moral and political responsibility for the Nakba of the Palestinian people. These two countries participated in turning our people in victims, when they decided to plant a foreign entity in our historical homeland, for their [own colonialist purposes."](https://www.memri.org/tv/pa-president-abbas-usa-britain-established-israel-get-rid-of-jews-no-historical-evidence)

Much truth of course but also many fallacies which make reconciliation difficult. There was never a "they" , who planted, "a foreign entity" and much less "for their own colonialist purposes". Such statements overlook the real history of antisemitism, the complex evolution of the 'Zionist Identity' and countless other factors we've tried to highlight, leading to good vs. bad conclusions which are misguided. He also said regarding the Jews in general that: 

>“They lie and lie, just like Goebbels. They lie, lie and lie until people believe”

Wrong, again, "the Jews" have their side of an incredibly complex history. Can one find individuals who have stretched the truth or even told a noble lie, of course. This applies to everyone. Again, this type of statement where one group of fellow homo sapiens are "good" and the others are clearly "bad" is mistaken and can only lead to increased polarization.


Sadly at these international organizations various groups of slightly smarter apes just vilify each other, constantly accusing each other of ‘committing war crimes’, of ‘violating human rights’. Again, for the 345th time, there is no one to blame for these misunderstandings and resulting tribalisms. ‘Crimes’ are committed by criminals, by people who know that what they are doing is clearly wrong, what the Zionists and Communists did, as well as Hamas and the numerous anti-Zionist Islamic militant groups, regardless of the suffering, should not be seen as crimes. Again! Just complex circumstances, intellectual errors and myths which then lead to the slaughters. The governing structures that arise from all sides just understandably polarize themselves given the immensely complex evolution of the various messes. But it is vitally important that people focus on the Jew-Gentile misunderstandings since they really are the root from which most of our problems arise.

On May 25th, 2023 US Presitend Biden gave a speech and launched the first "THE U.S. NATIONAL STRATEGY TO COUNTER ANTISEMITISM", he mention the following deep thoughts: “in America, evil will not win, hate will not prevail” and “the venom and violence of antisemitism will not be the story of our time.” Since your average Jewish organization and politicans lack a real understanding of the root causes of Jew-Gentile misunderstandings and resulting polarizations, all they can do is just 'good vs. evil', "expose hate", and fall for naive conspiracy theories in the case of the 'antisemites', so all we get is just increased polarizations. Remember, the tribalistic clueless politicians just mutilated the country over a cold as the government and 'The Priesthood of Scientism' funded the paralysis and mutilation. I fear that as the US government now begins giving more and more money to 'fight antisemitism' this will just lauch a CovidMania like self-mutilation. Jewish suffering and Jew-Gentile frictions must be understood in a rational post-Darwinian manner free of mythical 'good vs. maniacal evil' nonsense or psychobabble. Jews, through no fault of their own, keep opening Holocaust Museums all over the world spreading naive 'good vs. evil' and psychobabble. I was recently reminded of the numerous awful ramifications of this mentality when a German friend contacted me out of the blue to tell me that "Oh man. [child's name] now comes to me to tell me Germany is evil." If these Holocaust Museums and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) educated the public about the complex evolutionary factors discussed above which led to the numerous misunderstandings and polarizations leading to the wars and horrors, then awesome. But sadly, again, lacking the wisdom of 'The Austrians' summarized above, they just spread naive and polarizing 'good vs. evil', psychobabble, "the forces of good must preemptively attack the next Hitler", and so on. The ADL's slogan on their page on 5/2/2023 is 'Fighting Hate for Good'. No, we should not be looking to 'fight hate', especially with the increasing 'hate speech' laws that ultimately attempt to kill people for the ideas they hold. We should be aiming to understand the complex factors leading to hatreds, and via economic education and sympathy do our best to eventually minimize them.

Secular thinkers believe that Darwin triumphed over religious mysticism, not really, as long as even today's "leading intellectuals" tolerate this draconian coercive monopoly on information via Holocaust denial laws, as well as seeing Hitler and Nazi leadership as some mythical "evil" or "crazy" monsters instead of fellow homo sapiens who made understandable errors given certain ideas, mysticism still triumphs over reason and Darwin even among today's "leading thinkers". 

But again! This is NOT the "fault" of fellow homo sapiens who have absorbed a "Jewish Identity" or culture-software. And likewise, this is also NOT the fault of the naive antisemites. Again, who came first? The chicken or the egg?
