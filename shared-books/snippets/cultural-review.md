### Cultural Evolution Review.


Wherever there is complexity, mankind will fool itself via what is essentially mythology. A myth is "a widely held but false belief or idea". If the slightly smarter apes were wise and humble, they would refer to 'the Science', as 'the current myths', but we are killer arrogant apes. Mankind is essentially a mythical ape, as his understanding of the world improves, he is able to shatter simpler myths and create new myths about increasingly complex stuff. The myths-ideologies are being naturally selected primarily based on how much respect for private property (freedom) they allowed for, which inadvertently led to the emergence of 'the market process' and resulting global civilization-'Social Organism'-matrix. This process had less to do with mankind's "reason" than people imagine. Again, even though the respiratory, nervous, digestive, etc. systems that coordinate billions of cells to create an animal are the result of the actions of cells, the "designer" of such systems, was not their "reason", but natural selection. The same applies with our increasing respect for private property (freedom), 'the market process', and resulting 'Social Organism' which was "designed" by natural selection via Hayekian group-cultural evolution. 

Hayek explains:

>"We have never designed our economic system. We were not intelligent enough for that. We have stumbled into it and it has carried us to unforeseen heights and given rise to ambitions which may yet lead us to destroy it." [(Hayek F. A., 1981, p. 164)](https://books.google.com/books?id=9IpEBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA496&lpg=PA496&dq=%22We+have+never+designed+our+economic+system.+We+were+not+intelligent+enough+for+that.%22&source=bl&ots=unmrkCWHht&sig=ACfU3U3LTxMBTWY7xlzDtCXk_33E3TM_mQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjK8IzPs-7mAhUJvp4KHdyOB8UQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22We%20have%20never%20designed%20our%20economic%20system.%20We%20were%20not%20intelligent%20enough%20for%20that.%22&f=false)

With respect to private property:

>"…I am quite convinced nobody invented it for a known purpose, and to me the proof of this is that even now hardly anybody yet understands what the advantages of private property and the market society are." (Hayek essay "Individual and Collective Aims" published in "On Toleration" ISBN 0-19-827529-3)

We are now in a position to understand Hayek when he writes:

>"The ultimate decision about what is accepted as right and wrong will be made not by individual human wisdom but by the disappearance of the groups that have adhered to the "wrong" beliefs."

>"Culture is neither natural nor artificial, neither genetically transmitted nor rationally designed. It is a tradition of learnt rules of conduct which have never been 'invented' and whose functions the acting individuals usually do not understand" (Hayek "Law, Legislation and Liberty, Volume 3: The Political Order of a Free People" 1981, p. 155)

>"To understand our civilisation, one must appreciate that the extended order resulted not from human design or intention but spontaneously: it arose from unintentionally conforming to certain traditional and largely moral practices, many of which men tend to dislike, whose significance they usually fail to understand, whose validity they cannot prove, and which have nonetheless fairly rapidly spread by means of an evolutionary selection - the comparative increase of population and wealth - of those groups that happened to follow them. The unwitting, reluctant, even painful adoption of these practices kept these groups together, increased their access to valuable information of all sorts, and enabled them to be 'fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it' (Genesis 1:28). This process is perhaps the least appreciated facet of human evolution." [(Hayek, "The Fatal Conceit" p. 6)](https://books.google.com/books?id=YQLYAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=%22process+is+perhaps+the+least+appreciated+facet+of+human+evolution%22&source=bl&ots=OdrpACuHR_&sig=ACfU3U0UE4tgtm1gzIQrjd-chvvfdgZppg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjhwtC85fDoAhXhlHIEHRe7BEQQ6AEwBXoECAcQOw#v=onepage&q=%22process%20is%20perhaps%20the%20least%20appreciated%20facet%20of%20human%20evolution%22&f=false)


>"The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design."

The slightly smarter apes only look at the immediate effects of their central planning and other interventions into the complex socioeconomic order without realizing most of the time they do far more harm. Henry Hazlitt's famous economic lesson sums it up nicely:

>"The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups."

It should now be easy to understand why we have complex microchips, cellphones, airplanes, Internet, etc. and are parts of this amazing global 'Social Organism'-Matrix yet the public and elected leaders and even 'leading intellectuals' remain mired in tribalistic economic ignorance and resulting  militarism which at any moment can explode into nuclear war, or economic paralysis-chaos via 'central planning' as the 20th century Communism and now CovidMania are showing. Just like cells have no clue regarding how various 'natural selection evolved' biological "systems" coordinate them to be parts of complex multicellular organisms, and sometimes turn "cancerous" by reverting to their primal states of rapid-uncooperative cell replication-expansion, mankind too remains ignorant of the workings-evolution of the 'natural selection evolved' 'market process' and constantly reverts to coercive-competitionless-'central planning'-tribalism which destroys our order.

It is important that we focus on this understandable world-wide economic ignorance by the public as the root of our problems instead of which particular ideologues-politicians-groups end up acting in ways that lead to problems. 

Mises:

>"If public opinion is ultimately responsible for the structure of government, it is also the agency that determines whether there is freedom or  bondage. There is virtually only one factor that has the power to make people unfree—tyrannical public opinion. The struggle for freedom is ultimately not resistance to autocrats or oligarchs but resistance to the despotism of public opinion. It is not the struggle of the many against the few but of minorities—sometimes of a minority of but one man—against the majority. The worst and most dangerous form of absolutist rule is that of an intolerant majority."

And Hayek helps us go one step further in understanding the root causes of such ignorance by explaining how we are tribalistic dangerous slightly smarter apes that have inadvertently become parts of 'The Social Organism' even though the freedom and tolerance it requires constantly goes against our instincts-ignorance. Mises showed us how the Matrix works and Hayek showed us how it evolved.

As things stand today in mid 2023, we'd be lucky if there are 1,000 people in the entire planet who have had the truly miraculous luck of stumbling upon the 'The Austrians' and understand the aforementioned concepts and thus how the world works. The fact that so few people and a few 'think-tanks'-scholars understand this, and how little relative influence in actual politics they have, is further proof of how little 'reason' currently plays a factor in the workings of our socioeconomic order. We are essentially 'flying blind'. It is that simple. As we will soon discuss we are lucky to have even lasted this long. Two Nobel Laureates, James Buchanan (1986) and Hayek (1974) summarize our current situation in an interview that took place in 1978:

>Hayek: "If the politicians do not destroy the world in the next 20 years, which is very likely, I think there is a hope for afterwards... Perhaps 20 years is too short....but one thing which gives me confidence is I've watched the United States for 50 years and you seem to change your opinions fundamentally every 10"

And Buchanan highlights how little economic understanding has had to do with our prosperity and we essentially just got lucky that our government(legal framework) was created in a Federalized-Decentralized manner which helped slow down the inevitable trend towards disastrous monkey central planning:

>Buchanan : "It seems to me that we in the United States have really never had much understanding of sort of the principles of markets...the sort of interventionist collectivist socialist thrust has always been present and really the only reason we had burgeoning markets and rapid growth and so forth was largely because the government was decentralized [federalized and so forth"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxk053Tl4os&feature=youtu.be)


In the next few sections we will discuss how the slightly smarter apes and their "expert"-apes are as lost in "mythology" and resulting suffering as the theologians who orchestrated the Spanish Inquisition. We will discuss how the apes went wild in self-destruction via Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik revolution which sparked central-planning mythology-Communism throughout much of the world, and also discuss how the slightly smarter apes via the central planning and "regulating" of "science" has also led to disasters in nutrition-health, and when coupled with the usual economic ignorance, are the foundation of CovidMania socioeconomic suicide via lockdowns and coerced bullshit vaccinations and much more that is related. The myths are easy to refute, since myths are information, competition eventually destroys them, but the problem is that the slightly smarter apes inadvertently, via government force-monopoly prevent-retard such myth-busting. As we do so we always want to keep in mind 4 things:

1. An evolving 'echo chamber' of ideas-myths that populations hold.
2. A certain 'cognitive dissonance or bias' that understandably causes people to ignore competing-new ideas.
3. The 'incentive structure' that motivates people to act the way they do. 
4. How the above concepts affect the profitability-competitiveness-stability-harmony of the socioeconomic orders while being very cognizant of how 'Central Banking' money-creation (inflation) can be used by the economically ignorant apes to fund governments to greatly harm-warp-distort the social order.
