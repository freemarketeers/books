##### Vaccination mythology vs. reality and how the apes spread the myths with violence without a conspiracy.

The alleged benefits of vaccination is another myth. 

As the market process was quickly reordering mankind, incentivizing more and more people to move to cities, for a brief period people lived in horrible conditions. Human-animal feces and urine in the streets, no running water or sanitation, no refrigeration, the emergence of a scientific-chemical industry that filled cities with all kinds of substances we now know are very toxic like lead, arsenic, and many more. Malnutrition via caloric, vitamin and mineral deficiencies further contributed to numerous biochemical breakdowns which manifested themselves as various diseases like Scarlet Fever, Rheumatic Fever, Typhus, Cholera, Yellow Fever, Whooping Cough (Pertussis), Polio and many others. As to be expected and eventually happened, as the clever apes began to understand and appreciate the importance of sanitation (remember, the monopoly "experts" ridiculed Semmelweis), as their understanding of biochemistry increased and they began to understand how vitamin-mineral deficiencies could affect health and susceptibility to disease(lack of vitamin B1-beriberi, B12-anaemia,C-scurvy,D-rickets), as they restricted the use of dangerous chemicals, as it became cheaper and cheaper to live in a more nutritious and sanitary world, the diseases went away on their own. A society-wide breakdown in biochemistry led to the diseases-disorder, and as the proper biochemical order was restored thanks to better nutrition and reduction in environmental toxins, the imbalances-diseases began to go away. The diseases were going away thanks to 'the market process' you could say, but the apes gave credit to the vaccines-'virgin sacrifices' and their emerging great "scientists"-priests-planners. It was an understandable error-myth arising out of biochemical complexity. The graphs below show how diseases for which we vaccinate were going away on their own just like diseases like Scarlet Fever for which a vaccine was never widely used.

Same with Covid vaccines, by the time they were introduced, cases had already been going down.

Just like with Ancel Keys, and Karl Marx, Edward Jenner was another ignorant-negligent scientist who ignored much early criticism from other doctors regarding his hypothesis that inoculating people with a cow-pox concoction would then make them immune to smallpox. We quote the majestic book "Dissolving Illusions":


>"When Jenner published his paper in 1798 claiming lifelong immunity to smallpox and promoting his technique, many doctors who had seen smallpox follow cowpox challenged his doctrine at a meeting of the Medico-Convivial Society. 

>>"But he [Jenner] no sooner mentioned it than they laughed at it. The cow doctors could have told him of hundreds of cases where smallpox had followed cow-pox…"

>In 1799 Dr. Drake, a surgeon from Stroud, England, conducted an experiment to test Jenner’s new preventive using vaccine obtained directly from Edward Jenner. The children were then challenged with a smallpox inoculation to see if the cowpox procedure had been effective. 

>>"In three of them, a lad aged seventeen and two of the Colborne children (one four years, the other fifteen months), the cowpox vesicles came to early maturity and were scabbed under the usual time. The lad was inoculated with smallpox on the 20th December, being the eight day from his vaccination, and the two children on the 21st, being again the eight day. They all developed smallpox, both the local pustules and the general eruption with fever." 

>Dr. Hughes, another doctor from Stroud, reported that the children subsequently developed smallpox and suggested that the vaccination technique failed. Jenner received the report but decided to ignore the results." (Humphries)



The harm of vaccination, especially the US schedule, is in all likelihood one of the numerous areas where mainstream "experts" are essentially as wrong as they were when they vilified Semmelweis. And much of the increasingly important debates around the CovidVaccine and vaccination in general is simply a reflection of this fact. The apes are essentially going through the growing pains of overcoming a certain mythology. Let's look deeper. 

If it wasn’t until 2009 that the slightly smarter apes congratulated each other over what they think a ribosome looks like and how it functions, they have NO FUCKING CLUE what the near-term, much less long-term, and even less what the combined long-term effects, of routinely injecting children with numerous substances that make up vaccines like live viruses, foreign proteins, toxic chemical ‘adjuvants’, antibiotics, detergents, acid and alkaline buffers, a variety of animal cells, and foreign DNA and proteins and more. We quote 'Dissolving Illusions' again:

>"Instead of acknowledging the true cause for this extraordinary mortality decline before vaccination took hold, the medical profession embraced vaccination as a profitable and core medical tool. The problems with vaccines were consigned to oblivion or ensconced—and ultimately replaced with myth. Few ever bother to investigate or consider that anything else happened besides what they’ve been told. Vaccination is not a simple, straightforward cut-and-dry issue. It is complicated. The diseases are complicated and, moreover, the immune system is very superficially understood by even the most accomplished immunologists today.... “the immune system remains a black box, ” says Garry Fathman, MD, a professor of immunology and rheumatology and associate director of the Institute for Immunology, Transplantation and Infection... “Right now we’re still doing the same tests I did when I was a medical student in the late 1960s... ’’ It’s staggeringly complex, comprising at least 15 different interacting cell types that spew dozens of different molecules into the blood to  communicate with one another and to do battle. Within each of those cells sit tens of 
thousands of genes whose activity can be altered by age, exercise, infection, vaccination status, diet, stress, you name it.... That’s an awful lot of moving parts. And we don’t really know what the vast majority of them do, or should be doing."" (Humphries)


The “science” is definitely “settled” when it comes to the fact that as the number of vaccines given to kids has skyrocketed since the 1980s so have various illnesses and disabilities.

The "American Academy of Pediatrics" website mentions:

>"In the first six months of life, the total amount of aluminum contained in all routinely recommended vaccines is about 4 milligrams (mg). This is about one-half the amount of aluminum received from breast milk and less than one-tenth the amount of aluminum received from regular infant formula during the first six months of life. In over 70 years of use, aluminum salts have proven to be safe and [effective."](https://www.aappublications.org/news/2017/09/26/IDSnapshot092617#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20six%20months,about%204%20milligrams%20(mg).)

This means that through various injections an infant has 89,280,948,851,000,741,289 atoms of aluminum (a known neurotoxin) injected directly into the bloodstream during the first 6 months of life. If he were to drink these 4 mg, a highly evolved digestive system would keep most of them out since there are currently no known needs for aluminum in the body, and should it need to enter the bloodstream it would do so in the manner 4 billion+ years of natural selection have crafted, perhaps bound to some carrier molecule or protein in a manner that keeps-sustains the delicate ORDER that life is all about. But this filtering-ordering process is bypassed leading to a molecular chaos-disorder-damage. It is absurd to compare the direct injection of trillions upon trillions of atoms to the careful filtering-ordering that digestion would provide. And 70 years ago, in 1951 we didn't even know what DNA looked like! Below is a sample of a few vaccines (trade name) and some of [their ingredients](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf). Quadrillions upon quadrillions of foreign molecules injected into the mindbogglingly complex biochemical order of a child. An order which in its millions of years of evolution has not evolved to prevent these things from causing harm or safely remove them. 

1. Adenovirus vaccine: monosodium glutamate, sucrose, D-mannose, D-fructose, dextrose, human serum
albumin, potassium phosphate, plasdone C, anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline
cellulose, polacrilin potassium, magnesium stearate, cellulose acetate phthalate,
alcohol, acetone, castor oil, FD&C Yellow #6 aluminum lake dye.

2. Hep B (Heplisav-B): yeast protein, yeast DNA, deoxycholate, phosphorothioate linked
oligodeoxynucleotide, sodium phosphate, dibasic dodecahydrate, sodium
chloride, monobasic dehydrate, polysorbate 80 

3. Influenza (Afluria): sodium chloride, monobasic sodium phosphate, dibasic sodium phosphate,
monobasic potassium phosphate, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium
taurodeoxycholate, ovalbumin, sucrose, neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B, betapropiolactone, hydrocortisone, thimerosal (multi-dose vials).

4. MMRV (ProQuad): MRC-5 cells including DNA and protein, sucrose, hydrolyzed gelatin, sodium
chloride, sorbitol, monosodium L-glutamate, sodium phosphate dibasic,
recombinant human albumin, sodium bicarbonate, potassium phosphate
monobasic, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate dibasic, neomycin, bovine
calf serum, other buffer and media ingredients 

But the 'Priesthood of Scientism' allegedly understands all the complexity so they are "Safe and Effective".

As everyone knows or intuitively senses and already mentioned, Amazon.com and its reviews and best-sellers lists have evolved to be superior sources of information given the real competition among authors-ideas compared to the competition-less monopoly AMA-CDC-etc. If you visit amazon.com and do a search for "vaccines" by far the best-selling and best reviewed books will be highly critical of vaccines to various degrees.  For example "The Vaccine-Friendly Plan" by Paul Thomas MD and Jennifer Margulis PhD suggest less vaccines and not giving out so many at once. This already implies that our priesthood-monopoly of "experts" may be giving wrong advise so this is sacrilege as it is. It has over 2000 nearly-all-5-star reviews. Paul also published research showing that from amongst the thousands of children his practice saw those who were unvaccinated were the healthiest. And soon after had his medical license suspended. [Journalist Jeremy Hammond has a superb article about Paul's ordeal and much that is related.](https://www.jeremyrhammond.com/2021/03/26/oregon-medical-board-suspends-dr-paul-thomas-for-practicing-informed-consent/) "Miller's Review of Critical Vaccine Studies: 400 Important Scientific Papers Summarized for Parents and Researchers" by Neil Z. Miller (over 1000 reviews, solid 5 star average), as the title implies, it succinctly summarizes 400 scientific papers documenting vaccine-related harms. It is also an eye-soar to the priesthood-establishement since it is often the #1 best-seller in "Health Policy" category. "Dissolving Illusions: Disease, Vaccines, and the Forgotten History" by Suzanne Humphries MD and Roman Bystrianyk provides a wonderful history of the vaccination mythology and its battles to coerce people(Roman created a superb 2 hour [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HTRhKynQg0)). Suzanne has many excellent presentations easily found online ([smallpox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBRwY-gFTio),[polio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrb1XwI2_JA)). The image below shows the results as of 5/29/2021.

With the exception of the movie that got in there, except for one book, which appears to be an expensive textbook which happens to have a description that mentions "Described by Bill Gates as "an indispensable guide to the enhancement of the well-being of our world,""(only 34 reviews) .... All other books range from being highly critical of the current USA vaccination schedule, to being 100% against vaccines period. They have a whopping combined 11,038 mostly passionate and many-well-written 5 star reviews. Are these authors and the thousands upon thousands upon thousands of parents and curious educated people who actually bother to read technical books on amazon, and totally dominate in terms of sales and passionate and well-written reviews part of some conspiracy of charlatans? Or again, is this simply a sign that mankind is in the middle of overcoming a myth in this particular area arising out of biochemical complexity? Given the immense complexity are the vaccine-critics simply wrong-misguided instead of quacks? How do we "discover" this? Via freedom and its 'competitive knowledge discovery' of course.


As with Noakes(nutrition) and Danielle(economics), Dr. Suzanne Humphries was once a believer in the mainstream views-myths that the current ways we use vaccines are “safe and effective”. She often recalls how she got interested in the subject after having patients whose severe kidney problems occurred after vaccination. She was rightly concerned when she learned that patients in the hospital she worked would get vaccinated with little regard for their medical condition, she mentions:

>“the policy was… to offer every patient that was conscious no matter what their disease these vaccines …I think that should stand out to everybody as problematic. Would you want to give a flu shot and a Pneumococcal vaccine to a man that has cancer and is on chemotherapy that moment?…I saw vaccines given to people who are having heart attacks while they were having the heart attacks, while they had active sepsis, while they had new onset kidney problems, and numerous other ailments that there was no scientific literature to support vaccinating. But the ethos was “vaccines are safe and effective and they need to be given”


Once again it is monumentally important that we see our problems as rooted in economic ignorance, human tribalism-nature, and resulting mythology, NOT ill intent or “conspiracy” even if it is easy to find malicious people in the evolving structures-myths. It is the economic ignorance-myths and resulting violence of the masses which will throw a man in prison for not paying taxes to sustain public education, or trade his labor for less than the minimum wage, etc. Little needs to be said about anti-Capitalist violence like Lenin's Bolshevik revolution. Atkins was vilified and one would assume had his life threatened many times, and it is even more dangerous for vaccination critics [like Suzanne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjb0_w_MYys). Let us re-quote Hayek, people “often see in it merely an arbitrary structure maintained by some sinister power.” Take the pharmaceutical industry and vaccination as an example. Many people who are critical of vaccination to various degrees, the much-vilified “anti-vaxxers”, will make the error of believing that ‘Big Pharma’ as they like to call it, is the result of some malicious-evil people wanting to get rich at the expense of others. Most doctors-experts blindly-religiously pushing vaccination as one of “the greatest medical achievements of modern civilization” will see the anti-vaxxers as wrong-malicious-nutty(the very religious ones) because they know deep down inside that they are pushing the vaccines out of what they considers to be good science and not some malicious profiteering at the expense of the health of others. If every time a doctor stumbles upon someone questioning the efficacy and safety of the USA vaccine schedule he sees some very religious person accusing him and the medical industry of malice, it is totally understandable how the vaccine-freedom and anti-vaxx movement is seen as dangerous-irresponsible naïve people. 
Consider the following tirade against our disastrous medical establishment and resulting CovidMania by a well-known and courageous activist: 

>"this is evil. ...evil spelled backwards is live... if you want to live then you gotta get evil out of your life...Do you people know what evil looks like? Seriously, do you really know what evil looks like. Do you really get it that it's among us? When you see the chaos, when you see the dysfunction, evil's in the room. It's real easy. I've covered three wars and I've seen it in a war zone. Sometimes you don't see it when you're in civilization but it's there institutionally... Have respect for evil. Evil is mercurial, it pivots, it changes, it lies to you and it does it consciously without a conscience."

As great as the contributions in terms of exposing neglect and corruption in the medical industry by the above activist, one can see how the above quasi-religious language understandably causes the 'Priethood of Scientism' to neglect criticism and create an even more adversarial relationship. As with the atheistic Communism, the same pattern repeats, mostly well-intentioned myth-following people in an 'echo chamber' and incentive struture that ultimately causes much harm, are misidentified as 'evil'. Again, this erroneous pattern repeats in other complex fields. In economics you have naïve thinkers believing the Federal Reserve and government is run by some secret cabal of “elites” (Jews, Rockefellers, etc.) when it is actually run by totally clueless apes regardless of the fact that one can identify truly corrupt people. 

Suzanne, like Noakes and Danielle, wisely realize that their misguided co-professionals in medicine, nutrition, and economics respectively are not part of some conspiracy of bad guys, but just caught in a complex web of fallacies-incentives-errors-myths-etc. given the understandable complexity of the subject matter. Vaccine critics like Suzanne would seem to be the ones in most danger but the following logic applies to all courageous independent thinkers and how myths are sustained via violence. 

Assume 1 million people learn about her views, perhaps 999,000 will immediately just dismiss her as some quack for understandable reasons, 1,000 may immediately think she has to be some malicious charlatan who is carelessly spreading ideas that can put millions of lives at risk, 100 of these may go as far as harasing her online, and perhaps statistically 10 or so will be "heroic" enough to want to take concrete steps to harm her. A similar line of thought can apply to the existing companies, scientists, and bureaucrats that stand to lose financially if the vaccine-nutrition-economic critics are correct. Most will be normal civilized people and say "wow, we've been inadvertently doing considerable harm, time to do something else or differently", but statistically there will be a group that might want to physically harm the dissenters. During the class action lawsuite against Merck for its harmful drug Vioxx it was uncovered how Merck employees had a 'hit list' of drug critics to discredit. One email mentioned:

>"We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they [live..."](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/merck-created-hit-list-to-destroy-neutralize-or-discredit-dissenting-doctors/)

The same applies in other fields like religious mythology obviously, as in the killing of writers in the French satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo for having published material offensive to Muslims. Also take for example nationalism-militarism-tribalism. It is obvious that everyone who died in World War One died for absolutely nothing. And the same could be said about most military conflicts. But such an opinion will eventually upset-offend many "veterans"-heroes from which a group will resort to violence-intimidation and silence-kill the mythbusters-dissenters. This is how the myths-fallacies are spread by the slightly smarter dangerous apes in a manner that is NOT the result of grand conspiracies but is "indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design".
