### Government-'Public Sector' is an Inefficient Monopoly.


Since it is through freedom and resulting 'competitive knowledge discovery' that we both, free people from coercion-tyranny-slavery, and also discover the best information with which to reorder mankind, the role of governments should be to set the framework-laws that maximize such freedom-'competitive knowledge discovery' and NOT to attempt to manage-order society because governmental-'public sector' bureaucracies, being COERCIVE MONOPOLIES which get their life-order-sustaining wealth through taxes-compulsion are immune to the competitive-information-spreading incentives-pressures which motivate-force private sector orders to be efficient-innovative-hard-working. This helps one understand how Communism, which abolishes competing orders-companies and replaces them with a single competition-less monopolistic bureaucracy of 'experts', leads to a massive lack of production-innovation and eventually socioeconomic chaos-starvation as the economic pie continuously shrinks as has happened in every country that consciously attempts Communism-Socialism or inadvertently drifts in that direction as their governments get bigger and bigger (USA-World). Central plans can’t work if people are free to not go along with them, or use property as they wish instead of by the central plans — so they inevitably require compulsion-tyranny. For example, it is a criminal act in Communist countries like North Korea to start a business, in other words, to attempt a superior restructuring of society because it interferes with the plans of "the experts" who run the government. It is also a criminal act everywhere to not pay taxes that sustain public sector bureaucracies like "public education" so there is little incentive or wealth to sustain other, more desirable-superior competitors. For example, the NYC public(monopolistic) school bureaucracy consumes about $29,000 per year to “educate” a K-12 student. Refusing to pay a single dollar that goes to this bureaucracy is a criminal act. Taxes and all transfers of wealth from the private sector to the government, besides being an obvious burden to the people that had to sacrifice a part of their lives to earn such wealth and now have less wealth to trade for the things they want, simply destroy the private sector jobs the taxed-away spending would have sustained and replaces such productive-efficient and pie-increasing jobs for inefficient government ones or worse like militarism-wars. The former Soviet Union had plenty of highly educated scientists-'experts' whose plans required the coercion of millions, but they were thoroughly crushed by free Americans and their 'competitive knowledge discovery'. Socialist regimes and government in general also face an "incentive problem." In free societies, or the private sector, each person-cell is incentivized to be as productive as possible and keep inefficiencies to a minimum since he owns-keeps the additional wealth or losses. On the other hand, the government employee or bureaucrat gets the same pay (ability to then consume) whether his department did a good job (produced a lot) or not, and is also not risking his own wealth since that comes from the taxpayers. The image below is another one of our most powerful memes for explaining the difference between competitive-private-free orders(South Korea) and monopolistic-government-coerced orders (North Korea). Again, keep your eye on how information arises-spreads via competition and continuously restructures the social order.

Hayek:

>"The argument for liberty is not an argument against organization, which is one of the most powerful tools human reason can employ, but an argument against all exclusive, privileged, monopolistic organization, against the use of coercion to prevent others from doing better."

Action requires two things, the information that guides it, and the wealth that must be consumed while to action takes place. For 'competitive knowledge discovery' to work wealth must remain in private, not government-public hands. For example, in relatively free countries like the USA you have the freedom of speech necessary to criticize an awful public education system, or the disastrous Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but since you are still coerced via taxation to support those "ideas", the 'competitive knowledge discovery' is inexistent because bad ideas can still get the wealth they need for execution. 


In his essay ["Over-Legislation" Herbert Spencer](https://www.econlib.org/book-chapters/chapter-essay-over-legislation/) beautifully comments on the differences between governmental(law-made) orders and private/competitive ones:

>"How invariably officialism becomes corrupt every one knows. Exposed to no such antiseptic as free competition — not dependent for existence, as private unendowed organizations are, upon the maintenance of a vigorous vitality; all law-made agencies fall into an inert, over-fed state, from which to disease is a short step. Salaries flow in irrespective of the activity with which duty is performed; continue after duty wholly ceases; becomes rich prizes for the idle well born; and prompt to perjury, to bribery, to simony. ... Officialism is habitually slow. When non-governmental agencies are dilatory, the public has its remedy: it ceases to employ them, and soon finds quicker ones. Under this discipline all private bodies are taught promptness. But for delays in State-departments there is no such easy cure. ...

>Consider first how immediately every private enterprise is dependent upon the need for it; and how impossible it is for it to continue if there be no need. Daily are new trades and new companies established. If they subserve some existing public want, they take root and grow. If they do not, they die of inanition. It needs no act of Parliament, to put them down. As with all natural organizations, if there is no function to them, no nutrient comes to them, and they dwindle away. Moreover, not only do the new agencies disappear if they are superfluous, but the old ones cease to be when they have done their work. Unlike law-made instrumentalities…these private instrumentalities dissolve when they become needless. ...

>Again, officialism is stupid. Under the natural course of things each citizen tends towards his fittest function. Those who are competent to the kind of work they undertake, succeed, and, in the average of cases, are advanced in proportion to their efficiency; while the incompetent, society soon finds out, ceases to employ, forces to try something easier, and eventually turns to use. But it is quite otherwise in State-organizations. Here, as everyone knows, birth, age, back-stairs intrigue, and sycophancy, determine the selections, rather than merit. The “fool of the family” readily finds a place in the Church, if “the family” have good connections. A youth, too ill-educated for any active profession, does very well for an officer in the Army. Gray hair or a title, is a far better guarantee of naval promotion than genius is. Nay, indeed, the man of capacity often finds that, in government offices, superiority is a hindrance — that his chiefs hate to be pestered with his proposed improvements, and are offended by his implied criticism. Not only, therefore, is legislative machinery complex, but it is made of inferior materials." (Spencer, 1853)
