### Morals as Superior Information.

Morals are simply ways of acting, they are knowledge which also emerges and spreads via economic competition. Companies-orders that hire-nourish-'trade with' lazy, disrespectful, or corrupt people will be less competitive and be inevitably pressured-selected to hire people with better morals which in turn forces everyone to be respectful and hardworking regardless of race, sex, etc. Similarly, it is hard-working, tolerant, courteous people who thanks to competition inevitably force everyone else to be likewise. As Hayek tells us:

>"Competition is, after all, always a process in which a small number makes it necessary for larger numbers to do what they do not like, be it to work harder, to change habits, or to devote a degree of attention, continuous application, or regularity to their work which without competition would not be needed." [(Hayek, 1981, p. 77)](https://books.google.com/books?id=malYAQAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA77&lpg=RA2-PA77&dq=%22continuous+application,+or+regularity+to+their+work+which+without+competition+would+not+be+needed%22&source=bl&ots=kU2cMHmKYQ&sig=ACfU3U30vW96Pca8EGx2LO5qTHNN9P8FNw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwinl4zg4PDoAhUChHIEHWifC9IQ6AEwAHoECAsQKQ#v=onepage&q=%22continuous%20application%2C%20or%20regularity%20to%20their%20work%20which%20without%20competition%20would%20not%20be%20needed%22&f=false)

As millions of Italians, Britons, Germans and others from all over the world came to America, it was ultimately the competition which grows from 'private property' and thus individual liberty-freedom which stripped these people of their otherwise nationalistic-ethnocentric-tribalistic identities and evolved what came to be seen as the classic American character-ethos of wanting to be seen as a reputable-honest businessman-professional who treats everyone with respect and wears a business suit as opposed to older religious-ethnocentric dress. So not only does 'private property' "turn on" or leads to economic competition and other aspects of the market process and resulting social order-civilization, it also evolves our culture-identity to be ideally suited for participation in the 'Social Organism'.
