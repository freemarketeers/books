The greatest economist of the 20th century, Ludwig von Mises, and like-minded intellectuals known as ‘The Austrian School of Economics’, believed that the key to  socioeconomic prosperity and to ‘avoid the destruction of Western civilization’ was to ensure that ‘the immense majority’ of people understood economics. Mises explains:

>“If we want to avoid the destruction of Western civilization and the relapse into primitive wretchedness, we must change the mentality of our fellow citizens. We must make them realize what they owe to the much vilified “economic freedom,” the system of free enterprise and capitalism… those who call themselves educated must use their..power of reasoning for the refutation of erroneous ideas about social, political and economic problems and for the dissemination of a correct grasp of the operation of the market economy. They must start by familiarizing themselves with all the issues involved in order to teach those who are blinded by ignorance and emotions. They must learn in order to acquire the ability to enlighten the misguided many…The issues of society’s economic organization are every citizen’s business.”

Since socioeconomic chaos and wars are ultimately rooted in homo sapiens' tribalistic human nature and economic ignorance which always fools them into coercing each other via government, Mises and friends rightly struck at the root by focusing on economic education. Thus Mises again: "all reasonable men are called upon to familiarize themselves with the teachings of economics. This is, in our age, the primary civic duty." The Freemarketeers is a group of fellow Misesians who thus believe that economic education is our "primary civic duty" and collaborate to spread the vital wisdom of 'The Austrian School of Economics'.
