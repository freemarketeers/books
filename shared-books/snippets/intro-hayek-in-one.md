### The Vital Lessons in Two Paragraphs.


Let's try to summarize the wisdom of 'The Austrian School of Economics' in two paragraphs, albeit very abstract and dense ones whose concepts will be better explained throughout the book. 


The socioeconomic order inadvertently emerges from the tradition of private property. Our 'freedom to trade' our private property with anyone in the planet inadvertently turns mankind into a global supercomputer where people via the companies they create are motivated to innovate and learn from each other thus inadvertently cooperate to discover and spread superior information with which to serve customers and reorder all of mankind. It is our freedom as consumers to buy the best cars, and as producers to go into the auto manufacturing business, which motivates existing auto manufacturers(competitors) to innovate-compete-learn to produce the best cars. As millions of Italians, Britons, Germans and others from all over the world came to America, it was ultimately the competition which grows from ‘private property’ and thus individual liberty which stripped these people of their otherwise nationalistic, ethnocentric, tribalistic “identities” and evolved what came to be seen as the classic American character of wanting to be seen as a reputable and honest businessman or professional who treats everyone with respect and wears a business suit as opposed to older ethnocentric attires. Thus freedom and resulting *'competitive knowledge discovery'*, NOT coercive-centralized-competitionless-monopoly-government control by "experts" or "great leaders", as opposed to leading to chaos-injustice, is what 1) motivates the discovery and spread of superior information and resulting order-civilization,  2) shields us from being coerced into going along the plans of others, 3) civilizes us, and 4) discovers THE TRUTH! Government is a coercive and competition-immune growth whose regulations and bureaucracies  paralyze or slow 'competitive knowledge discovery' and inevitably consumes more than it produces and should thus be kept to a minimum, otherwise, as the history of Socialist-Communist governments always shows, the socioeconomic order shrinks and dissolves into chaos and war. Coercion, whether it is by the patriarchy, slave-master, Church, and ultimately government, is not only a burden to those being coerced, but also destroys this wonderful mechanism of 'competitive knowledge discovery' which is what has discovered and spread the superior information which replaced erroneous mythology and continuously reordered mankind into increasingly more technologically advanced, productive, and prosperous states. This helps us understand how as the coercive and thus competitionless-monopoly decision-making power of the Catholic Church was reduced, and individual freedom increased in Europe, so did emerging 'competitive knowledge discovery' thus taking Western civilization to prominence, but as the social order got mind-bogglingly complex in the late 1800s and Socialist-Central-Planning mythology arose, freedom and emerging 'competitive knowledge discovery' was destroyed leading to immense suffering in Communist countries like the former Soviet Union and pre-Capitalist China.

Knowing that 'private property' and emergent freedom is the simple tradition that leads to a chain-reaction of incentives which generates and spreads the information that creates the social order, we can see that over thousands of years those tribes-societies whose customs-religions-myths inadvertently became more peaceful and thus less violent, extended peace-friendship-tolerance-trade to those outside the tribe, etc., in other words, those who tended to respect 'private property' and thus individual freedom and emerging business-capitalist culture more and more, would become more productive-advanced-powerful, and as they were 'naturally selected' relative to other groups, they would inadvertently spread the very customs-myths that allowed them to reach such relative heights. Thus the true sort of 'designer' of "the market process" or "free-market economy" or capitalism was our old friend 'natural selection' or competition acting on groups-cultures, inadvertently selecting those customs-ideologies-myths-concepts as if they were "fitter" genetic mutations. The fact that the market economy-order was 'designed' by an evolutionary process, NOT our "reason", helps us understand how we have inadvertently created this amazing Matrix with its complex microchips-Internet-Airplanes yet still be economically-ignorant-intuitively-tribal slightly smarter apes, who fooled by the growing complexity of the social order, history, biochemistry, environment, etc. are constantly coercing each other via massive competition-less-monopoly-governments led by "great leaders"-theologians-experts-apes which destroy our very freedom and resulting 'competitive knowledge discovery' that creates our civilization and end up propagating what is essentially mythology and inevitable wars-tyrannies.
