##### Introduction to Scientism.


The Soviet Union and Communism-Socialism in general could be seen as the perfect examples of "scientism". The slightly smarter apes realized they were following religious myths and via their "reason" replaced The Church-tradition and its priests with their costumes for "scientists"-reason and their white lab coats-costumes. Instead of scholars looking for meaning in religious scriptures, we now had economists-econometricians-scientists "using the latest techniques and econometric models" attempting to 'centrally plan-regulate-dictate' the social order with disastrous results. US president Biden vowed that "our administration will lead with science and scientists, with a CDC, an NIH, that will be free, totally free from political influence, a surgeon general who is independent, an FDA whose decisions are based on science and science alone." and his Chief of Staff added that "the president-elect will sign additional executive actions to address the climate crisis with the urgency the science demands and ensure that science guides the administrationâ€™s decision making." Thus a competition-immune Soviet Union-like pattern simply re-emerges to deal with complexity wherever we find it (medicine, economics, environment, history, etc.)
