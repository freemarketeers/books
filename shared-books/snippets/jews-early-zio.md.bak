#### Inadvertent evolution of the disastrous Zionist "Identity" 

Next we want to further identify, understand, and help overcome a repeating pattern that once again threatens to destroy civilization via the Russia-Ukraine war. Some homo sapiens make numerous errors leading to antisemitism, which then leads 'Jewish Identity' and sympathetic supporters-identities, lacking the proper understanding of the root causes of antisemitism, to treat the antisemites, not as misguided homo sapiens, but as some “evil” people to be silenced, made criminals out of (for allegedly ‘spreading hate’), or destroyed via disastrous world wars as with Hitler’s Germany and World War Two. Jews, oftentimes with admirable patience, do try to educate the "antisemites", but they do so by showing them the history of Jewish suffering instead of getting to the root socioeconomic fallacies mentioned above since they are unaware of them, so the fallacies and resulting antisemitism and related chaos continues.

Let us look at Zionism, the idea that the fellow homo sapiens who have absorbed a 'Jewish Identity', should live in their own country which eventually became today's Israel. Both antisemitism and Zionism are rooted in the same intellectual error, that the homo sapiens who “identify as Jews” are so different from the other homo sapiens that they must leave the real thousands of towns and Synagogues where for hundreds of years they were an integral part of Western Civilization to create a country (Israel) based on religious mythology in an area already populated by others who had a different “identity” (Muslims, Christians, and fellow anti-Zionist Jews) and for numerous understandable reasons were adamantly opposed to the creation of a “Jewish State” in their surroundings. 

By the late 1800s, as reason was replacing religious mysticism-squabbles, as the idea that all homo sapiens should have freedom and the same individual rights was spreading, things were quickly improving for all Europeans and especially Jews. As the Church and its monarchical rulers were being replaced by nationalist representative governments, the idea of Jewish Nationalism understandably emerged. Also as this increase in freedom *inadvertently* led to superior *'competitive knowledge discovery'* which led to Europeans increasing their dominance of the world, so did the potential influence of European Jews. Given their ill treatment in the form of pogroms and legal restrictions as well as some religious zeal, eventually the idea of having their own country-state (an ideology which is known as Zionism) gained enough traction, a “traction” which understandably increased as Hitler rose to power. Theodore Herzl, the sort of father of political Zionism, envisioned this country in Palestine which contained many ancestral Jewish sites like Jerusalem. At first his pitch for Zionism was not very popular. The rabbinical establishment, reflecting views shared by most Jews in Munich, Germany, where Herzl wanted to hold the First Zionist Congress, strongly rejected the idea so the meeting was moved to Basle Switzerland(29-31st/8/1897). They told him :

“…how can one speak with people who on the one hand are fanatics regarding Jewish nationhood and, on the other hand, complain that the Austrian government required a baptismal certificate from the candidate for the position of secretary of Bukowina. If the Austrian Jews support the efforts of the Zionists, then they should not complain that they are treated by the government like foreigners and are barred from public office. *We, however, can say to our fellow countrymen with complete conviction that we comprise a separate community solely with respect to religion. Regarding nationality, we feel totally at one with our fellow Germans and therefore strive towards the realization of the spiritual and moral goals of our dear fatherland with an enthusiasm equaling theirs…*.Eighteen hundred years ago, history made its decision regarding Jewish nationhood through the dissolution of the Jewish State and the destruction of the Temple”

This makes perfect sense. German, Polish, Russian, Spanish Jews spoke German, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and for centuries their identities had evolved in those locations where their Synagogues had been built and they made real tangible contributions to the evolution of Western Civilization. Until the last couple of centuries most people had never even seen a map and their "identities" were tied, not to a nation, but to a local town or village. The cultural concept of a 'Nation' as we currently treat it, did not generally arise until maps, better communication, faster transportation, etc. allowed our more local-tribal 'identities' to be expanded to now include much larger groups. This of course has led to bigger and bigger tribalistic National and then World Wars.

Since Jews tend to be an extended blood-related family that has been an oftentimes persecuted minority due to religious squabbles of antiquity-etc., the sense of "identity" and ethnocentrism is understandably stronger and has been an important albeit unfortunate factor in both antisemitism and Zionism. Again, both antisemitism and Zionism are rooted in the same intellectual error, that the slightly smarter apes who "identify as Jews" are so different from the other slightly smarter apes that they must live apart. Theodore Herzl himself highlighted this ideological congruence of both Zionists and antisemites in his foundational book "The Jewish State"(1896) that:

>"The anti-semites will be our most steadfast friends." "The anti-Semitic countries will be our allies" "Great exertions will hardly be necessary to spur on the movement. Anti-Semites provide the requisite impetus. They need only do what they did before, and then they will create a desire to emigrate where it did not previously exist, and strengthen it where it [existed before."](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-the-jewish-state-quot-theodor-herzl)

We already mentioned how freedom and the competition that grows from it was shaping the relatively "ethnocentric" identities of all peoples and turning us into worldly citizens. During the early days of Zionism, many Jews were divided into the Zionists and anti-Zionists ("assimilationists"). Chaim Weizmann, the leading Zionist figure after Herzl’s death in 1904, lamented how "assimilated Jews" were "dead against Zionism" and identified Zionism (correctly IMHO) as "a primitive tribalism":

>"For assimilated Jews...They looked upon it...as a primitive tribalism. They felt themselves...called upon to "rescue" Judaism from Zionism...these people are dead against Zionism...Zionism is not meant for those people who have cut themselves adrift [from Jewry..."](https://books.google.com/books?id=fl2mDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT195&lpg=PT195&dq=%22these+people+are+dead+against+Zionism%22&source=bl&ots=a-o-r-Wnsc&sig=ACfU3U0LI-8_Jfxm7zq0ugg-knd9AF_uBw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwirlLKh3PDmAhXLl54KHeA0CtwQ6AEwAHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22these%20people%20are%20dead%20against%20Zionism%22&f=false)

Of course! That rapidly increasing number of very well educated cosmopolitan "assimilated Jews" spread all over Europe-USA just wanted to be fellow human beings or equal world citizens free of ancient tribalisms-mysticisms-identities. Unfortunately, for very understandable reasons-factors for which nobody is to blame and are ultimately rooted in economic ignorance, like a rocket that is just about to reach orbit but runs out of fuel and comes crashing down to earth, Zionism would inadvertently pull 'Jewish Identity' and all of Western Civilization back to an increasingly ethnocentric identity-worldview with disastrous consequences. The Zionist Jews began to tie their “identity” to a massive error and eventually reach the stage where we are today, where saying that Zionism and the resulting Israeli state as it currently functions has been a massive error, essentially what most Jews in the late 1800s were wisely saying, is seen by many Jews today as antisemitic.  CEO of the Anti-Defamation League Jonathan Greenblatt has mentioned that "Anti-Zionism is antisemitism". Like a young ideologue who is persuaded by Marx’s "Communist Manifesto" and sees businessmen as sinister capitalists to be killed, as Israeli author of the excellent book 'The Invention of the Jewish People', Shlomo Sand, notices: "Zionism has become…. [a sort of Stalinism"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHCaykhbvvA) which seeks to make it a ‘hate crime’ to criticize or want to replace the current Israeli-Zionist state, and thus imprison, beat and ultimately kill those who disagree with Zionist mythology. Once again! Very importantly! This should NOT be seen as the “fault” of the fellow homo sapiens who have absorbed a 'Zionist identity'. The Bolshevik hordes and their intellectuals and politicians which brought about so much tyranny, like the witch burners, were just executing the myths that polluted their minds. Just like the obvious desire of some businessmen to pay employees less in order to make large profits is all Communists needed to see to justify their ideology and kill the businessmen-capitalists, similarly, the Zionists can easily find “anti-Semites” and people who erroneously accuse Jews of ‘plotting’ capitalism or communism or killing Jesus and all that nonsense to justify their Zionism. Again, there is no one to blame here, we just have 'identities' evolving and reacting to each other in various ways. 

Given the above it is easy to understand how the Zionist mindset-identity-software would continue to spread. Zionism was an error made not by "Jews", but by Europeans-mankind in general. Actually, it is not really an error, just an "evolved" ideological movement, that similar to Socialism, would be disastrous. Had there been no antisemitism-Jew-Gentile conflicts in ‘Western Civilization’, Zionism and resulting ongoing disastrous ramifications simply would not have occurred. Many Christians with the best of intentions also played a significant role, it easily made sense for many Christians that Jews should live in their ancient lands, for example American president during World War One Woodrow Wilson too liked the idea: “To think, that I the son of a manse should be able to help restore the Holy Land to its people.” Wanting to win the support of Jews everywhere for their war against Germany, on November 2nd 1917, via the ‘Balfour Declaration’, the British government officially made it a policy to help create a “National Home” for Jews in Palestine. Former Prime Minister James Balfour mentioned in a cabinet meeting that:

>“The vast majority of Jews in Russia and America... now appear to be favorable to Zionism. If we could make a declaration favorable to such an ideal, we should be able to carry on extremely useful propaganda in both Russia and America.” (Judis, p. 59)

British Prime Minister Lloyd George added that:

>“the Zionist leaders gave us a definite promise that, if the Allies committed themselves to giving facilities for the establishment of a National Home for the Jews in Palestine, they would do their best to rally to the Allied cause.” (Judis, p. 59) 

What about the 700,000 or so Arabs who already inhabited Palestine?

When the First World War ended (1918) and the victors (British-French-US) were deciding what to do with the acquired lands (Palestine), in order to better understand the wishes of the local population regarding the possibility of creating a Jewish state in the land, the USA organized the King-Crane commission. Among their findings-recommendations were:

>“We recommend…serious modification of the extreme Zionist programme for Palestine of unlimited immigration of Jews, looking finally to making Palestine distinctly a Jewish State…The fact came out repeatedly in the Commission’s conference with Jewish representatives, that the Zionists looked forward to a practically complete dispossession of the present non-Jewish inhabitants of Palestine, by various forms of purchase.…it is to be remembered that the non-Jewish population of Palestine — nearly nine tenths of the whole — are emphatically against the entire Zionist program…there was no one thing upon which the population of Palestine were more agreed than upon this. To subject a people so minded to unlimited Jewish immigration, and to steady financial and social pressure to surrender the land, would be a gross violation of the principle just quoted, and of the people’s rights…It is to be noted also that the feeling against the Zionist program is not confined to Palestine, but shared very generally by the people throughout Syria as our conferences clearly showed. The Peace Conference should not shut its eyes to the fact that the anti-Zionist feeling in Palestine and Syria is intense and not lightly to be flouted. No British officer, consulted by the Commissioners, believed that the Zionist program could be carried out except by force of arms…That of itself is evidence of a strong sense of the injustice of the Zionist program, on the part of the non-Jewish populations of Palestine and Syria. Decisions, requiring armies to carry out, are sometimes necessary, but they are surely not gratuitously to be taken in the interests of a serious injustice. For the initial claim, often submitted by Zionist representatives, that they have a “right” to Palestine, based on an occupation of 2,000 years ago, can hardly be seriously considered.…The places which are most sacred to Christians-those having to do with Jesus-and which are also sacred to Moslems, are not only not sacred to Jews, but abhorrent to them. It is simply impossible, under those circumstances, for Moslems and Christians to feel satisfied to have these places in Jewish hands, or under the custody of Jews… In fact, from this point of view, the Moslems, just because the sacred places of all three religions are sacred to them have made very naturally much more satisfactory custodians of the holy places than the Jews could be…In view of all these considerations, and with a deep sense of sympathy for the Jewish cause, the Commissioners feel bound to recommend that only a greatly reduced Zionist program be attempted by the Peace Conference, and even that, only very gradually initiated. This would have to mean that Jewish immigration should be definitely limited, and that the project for making Palestine distinctly a Jewish commonwealth should be given up.”


A group of prominent Arab Muslims and Christians sent a letter to the Paris Peace Conference (1919) expressing their opposition to Zionism.

>“The principles of justice and equity cannot admit of the crushing of a nation by an influx of a greater number of another foreign nation that will assimilate her… The country is ours and has been so of old. We have lived in it longer than they did, and have worked in it more than they did. Our historical and religious relations with it, we Moslems and Christians, far exceed those of the Jews. Therefore, their claim to their ancient historical rights in the country do not give them the right of appropriating it, in as much as in our historical rights we Arabs cannot justify our claims in Spain, our old home, where our rule and glory flourished for eight centuries and this gave birth to the modern civilization of Europe… Does justice then allow of the violation of the rights of the majority?”

But the imperialist attitude of the British-Europeans is perfectly captured by former Prime Minister Lord Balfour who said at the time:

>“I am quite unable to see why Heaven or any other Power should object to our telling the Moslem what he ought to think”

And:

>“For in Palestine we do not propose to even go through the form of consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country though the American [King-Crane] Commission is going through the form of asking what they are. The Four Great Powers [Britain, France, Italy and the United States] are committed to Zionism. And Zionism, be it right or wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age-long traditions, in present needs, and future hopes, of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land.”

If the Palestinians-natives had some form of truly representative government the Zionist error could have been prevented but to a significant degree this was not to be thanks to Zionism’s perhaps most influential ally, Winston Churchill. During the First World War, serving as First Lord of the Admiralty, Churchill faced a growing shortage of acetone, which was needed as part of the process used to make cordite, an essential naval explosive. Chaim Weizmann just happened to be a chemist and was able to solve this problem thus increasing his influence with leading British authorities. When Prime Minister David Lloyd George asked Weizmann what he wanted for payment, according to Lloyd George, Weizmann said “the rights to Palestine” During the years 1920-1922 Churchill was the Colonial Secretary allowing him to call the shots in the British controlled Middle East. On May 12th, 1921 Palestinian representatives sent the Colonial Office resolutions asking for representative government, the annulling of the Balfour Declaration, and prohibition of Jewish immigration, but on May 31st Churchill told the British Cabinet that:

>“he had decided to suspend the development of representative institutions in Palestine ‘owing to the fact that any elected body would undoubtedly prohibit further immigration of Jews’ ” (Gilbert, 1991, p. 437)

Many of the Zionists were atheist Communists intent on creating a Socialist state whose views could not have been more abhorrent to the surrounding population. Ben Gurion was one of these and he visited Moscow on Nov. 7th 1923 to celebrate the 6th anniversary of the 'October Revolution' as a representative of the 'General Organization of Hebrew Workers in Palestine' (the 'Histadrut'). In early May two rival Jewish communist organizations (one of them calling for the creation of a “Soviet Union of Palestine”) held parades and came to blows with each other sparking a riot which would last many days, spread to surrounding cities-towns, and take the lives of dozens of Jews and Arabs. Churchill historian Martin Gilbert writes that:

>“In response, the British administration imposed a collective fine on the Arabs of Jaffa, and on the Arab villages from which some of the attackers had come. On 17 November Churchill wrote to his officials: ‘Sir Herbert Samuel should be held stiffly up to the enforcement of the fines on Jaffa.’… Churchill was surprised and shocked when Samuel informed him that the Arabs had been provoked to riot by a hard core of Jewish Communists. It was Samuel’s responsibility, Churchill replied, to ‘purge the Jewish Colonies and newcomers of Communist elements, and without hesitation or delay have all those who are guilty of subversive agitation expelled from the country.’ Whatever part Jewish Communists had played in the Jaffa riots, Churchill told Samuel, he was even more angered by the Arab attempt to use violence throughout Palestine ‘in the hope of frightening us out of our Zionist policy.’” (Gilbert, 2007, p. 73)

Churchill, the quintessential British racist-colonialist, was enamored by the progress Zionists were making in cultivating land and was not impressed with the Arabs whom Churchill criticized:

>“Left to themselves, the Arabs of Palestine would not in a thousand years have taken effective steps towards the irrigation and electrification of Palestine. They would have been quite content to dwell –a handful of philosophic people—in the wasted sun-scorched plains, letting the waters of the Jordan continue to flow unbridled and unharnessed into the Dead Sea.” (Gilbert, 2007, p. 81)

In another comment Churchill mentioned that “The injustice is when those who lived in the country leave it to be desert for thousands of years” (Gilbert, 2007, p. 113)

With the rise of Hitler in Germany in 1933, the British, with Zionist encouragement, were turning Palestine into the preferred destination for some of the unwanted European Jews.  And, unfortunately, unwanted they were. We have already touched upon some of the reasons why Jews were disliked to which one should add the fact that Hitler rose to power during a worldwide economic depression which made potential host countries to Jewish immigration even less receptive to it. While sympathizing and condemning the legal restrictions and mistreatment of Jews by the Third Reich, most countries felt like they had enough problems dealing with their own poor and unemployed to allow large numbers of displaced Jews to compete for a seemingly scarce number of jobs and that sort of thing. For example, while discussing Jewish immigration to Canada during Hitler’s regime Theodore S. Hamerow writes:

>“In Canada as in all democratic nations, economic need reinforced ethnic prejudice in generating opposition to the admission of refugees. In Canada, however, that opposition became stronger than in any country outside Eastern Europe. It gained force, moreover, just as the need for asylum was growing more urgent. In early years after the Great Depression, between 1931 and 1933, close to 15,000 Jews entered Canada. But after the establishment of the National Socialist regime in Germany, the doors began to close, and they remained closed or almost closed until the collapse of the Third Reich. Between 1933 and 1945, a mere 5,000 Jews found refuge in Canada…in none was the opposition to the admission of victims of Nazi bigotry as strong or effective as in Canada.” (Hamerow, p. 156)

With respect to Jewish immigration to the U.S., Johnson writes:

>“It was in the United States, however, that the Bolshevik takeover, and its association with radical Jews, had the most serious consequences. In France, Jews might be assailed from right and left, but the country continued to be generous in receiving Jewish refugees throughout the 1920s and even during the 1930s. In America, however, the Bolshevik scare effectively ended the policy of unrestricted immigration which had been the salvation of European Jewry…The 1924 Johnson-Reed Act…cut total immigration to 154,000 yearly, and reduce the Polish, Russian, and Rumanian quotas, almost entirely of Jews, to a total of 8,879. It was effectively the end of mass Jewish immigration to the US.” (Johnson, 1988, pp. 459-60)

In 1918, when Palestine became a British dominion there were about 60,000(8%) Jews and 700,000(92%) Arabs, by 1922 84,000(10%) Jews and 760,000(90%) Arabs, by 1931 Jews were about 17% of the population. Once Hitler rose to power the years 1933-36 brought record numbers of Jews to Palestine, 30,000, 42,000, 62,000, and 30,000 respectively, about 164,000 in total, which quickly led to Jews being almost 28% of the population by 1937. Zionist leader and future Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion had no problems understanding the Arab point of view:

>“There is a fundamental conflict. We and they want the same thing: We both want Palestine. And that is the fundamental conflict”… “Were I an Arab…I would rise up against immigration liable sometime in the future to hand the country and all of its Arab inhabitants over to Jewish rule. What Arab cannot do his math and understand that immigration at the rate of 60,000 a year means a Jewish state in all of Palestine?” (Teveth, pp. 166-8)

This large influx of Jewish immigrants and obvious acceleration-intensification of the Zionist program led to the 1936-39 Arab revolt, which consisted of various boycotts and strikes, armed resistance against the occupying British authorities, acts of sabotage like repeated bombings of oil pipelines, and sporadic attacks against Jewish settlements. The revolt was brutally suppressed by the British which often used collective punishment like reducing entire villages to rubble, holding thousands of people without trial in poorly sanitized and deplorable detention centers, and just generally applying the sort of harsh military justice that leads to frequent miscarriages of justice and only serves to both demoralize and aggravate an entire population based on the actions of a few. The revolt proved to be counterproductive for the Arabs who lost many more lives and much of their leadership and had little effect in curbing Jewish immigration which continued to increase. (Morris, 1999, pp. 159-60)

The revolt did cause the British to finally begin to restrict Jewish immigration and take Arab grievances more seriously leading to a reformulation of British policy in what came to be known as the 1939 ‘White Paper’ which took effect on May 19, 1939.   The British were no longer in favor of a Jewish State or distinctively Jewish national home as had been implied by the Balfour declaration, but were now in favor of a single Palestinian state where Jews and Arabs would get along as equals. Immigration would also be restricted during the next 5 years to a combined total of 75,000 and land sales to Jews would be restricted-regulated by British authorities.

On May 23rd, 1939 Churchill gave a speech in the House of Commons attacking this change in policy. He said:

>“To whom was the pledge of the Balfour Declaration made? It was not made to the Jews of Palestine, it was not made to those who were actually living in Palestine. It was made to world Jewry and in particular to the Zionist associations. It was in consequence of and on the basis of this pledge that we received important help in the war.”

It is important to note how Churchill is admitting that Zionist Jews helped them win World War One against Germany.

About a month earlier on April 1st, 1939 that crazy and irrational maniacal Hitler gave a speech where he mentioned “What right, for example, has England to shoot down Arabs in Palestine just because they defend their homeland; who gives them this right?” And in another speech a few weeks later on April 28th Hitler reminded the self-righteous Roosevelt of certain obvious facts:

>“Similarly the fact has obviously escaped Mr. Roosevelt's notice that Palestine is at present occupied not by German troops but by the English; and that the country is undergoing restriction of its liberty by the most brutal resort to force, is being robbed of its independence and is suffering the cruelest maltreatment for the benefit of Jewish interlopers. The Arabs living in that country would therefore certainly not have complained to Mr. Roosevelt of German aggression, but they are voicing a constant appeal to the world, deploring the barbarous methods with which England is attempting to suppress a people which loves its freedom and is merely defending it.”

England’s change of heart, regardless of Churchill’s efforts, was unwelcomed by the Zionists especially once World War Two broke out in September of that year. Zionist paramilitary groups like the Irgun and Stern Gang, which would usually fight Arabs, began to wage a bloody terrorist campaign against the British once the war ended. Perhaps the most famous of such terrorist acts against the British was the bombing of the King David Hotel by the Irgun (leb by future Israeli PM Menachem Begin) on July 22nd 1946 where 91 people were killed and another 41 injured. By 1947, after dealing with Zionist animosity as well as the expenses associated with supporting nearly 100,000 troops in Palestine, the British felt like they had had enough and decided to turn over the whole mess to the United Nations. 

The United Nations created the UNSCOP(UN Special Committee on Palestine) and came up with a *recommendation*, the “U.N. partition plan of 1947” (aka Resolution 181) which gave 55% of the land to 37% of the people(Jews) for a future Jewish state and 44% of the land for the majority and native Arab population for their future state, with the city of Jerusalem administered by the U.N. Going against the advice of the State Department and the Pentagon, US President Harry Truman was persuaded by the tremendous pro-Zionist environment and went along and endorsed the recommendation. Needless to say the Arabs felt like some white guys in Europe deciding how to restructure the area, especially in such a manner, was not acceptable. The Zionists were understandably fed-up with the usual antisemitism and sporadic clashes with local Arabs, and as the British withdrew their forces they went on the offensive encouraging the depopulation of Arab villages and towns. Brigades were instructed:

“In the conquest of villages in your area, you will determine –whether to cleanse or destroy them.” (Morris, 2004, p. 165)

The common strategy was to use mortars to rain in bombs from above which would cause panic and exodus and then move in to finish the job. For example, one particular offensive in the coastal city of Haifa is partly described by Morris as follows: 

>“In preparation for the assault, around midnight 21/22 April, the Hagana had let loose with a 15-minute, 50-round barrage of heavy mortars on the lower city, triggering ‘great panic…and the mass exodus began’. Further barrages were released periodically during the night and in the morning of 22 April. By early afternoon, the attacks had broken the back of Arab resistance. Hours earlier, at 09:00, 22 April, Hagana units had reached Hamra Square and found it deserted: ‘All was desolate, the shops closed, no traffic…only several sick old Arab men and women moved about, confused.’”  (Morris, 2004, p. 190)

Later in the day a British intelligence officer describes the scene at the Haifa harbor’s entrance:

>“During the morning [the Jews], were continually shooting down on all Arabs who moved both in Wadi Nisnas and the Old City. This included completely indiscriminate and revolting machine gun fire, mortar fire and sniping on women and children sheltering in churches and attempting to get out…there was considerable congestion outside the East Gate of hysterical and terrified Arab women and children and old people on whom the Jews opened up mercilessly with fire.”  (Morris, 2004, p. 191)

Perhaps the most famous attack was the so-called “Deir Yassin massacre” which took place on April 9, 1948. Albert Einstein, along with 27 prominent Jews in New York, published a letter in the Dec 4th 1948 issue of the New York Times condemning the attack and Menachem Begin’s group, the Irgun, who was behind it:

>“terrorist bands attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants - 240 men, women, and children - and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of Jerusalem. Most of the Jewish community was horrified at the deed, and the Jewish Agency sent a telegram of apology to King Abdullah of Trans-Jordan. But the terrorists, far from being ashamed of their act, were proud of this massacre, publicized it widely, and invited all the foreign correspondents present in the country to view the heaped corpses and the general havoc at Deir Yassin.”

Now, I personally have little doubt that Menachem Begin would NEVER order or condone any massacre as implied above. Atrocity myths easily arise in complex and emotionally charged environments like wars. In fairness to Begin, here is his take on what happened:

>“To counteract the loss of Dir Yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish officials, fearing the Irgun’s men as political rivals, seized upon this Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced to reprimand the Irgun before he had had time to sift the truth. Out of evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of Israel. The “Dir Yassin Massacre” lie is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.” (Begin, pp. 226-7) 

How many of the deaths were due to indiscriminate killing might be lost in the past but news of the attack on Deir Yassin and alleged atrocities spread quickly helping spur panic and accelerating the mass exodus of Palestinians.

The thought of forcibly transferring Arabs to make way for a Jewish homeland had been in the mind of top Zionist leaders for a long time. For example, among many statements supporting transfer by leading Zionists, leading Zionist and eventual first Prime Minister of Israel David Ben Gurion mentioned in 1938:

>“With compulsory transfer we [would] have a vast area [for settlement]….I support compulsory transfer. I don’t see anything immoral in it.” (Morris, 1999, p. 144)

On the 6th of February 1948, during a Mapai Party Council, someone mentioned that “we have no land there” while referring to some lands west of Jerusalem, to which Ben Gurion replied:

>“The war will give us the land. The concepts of “ours” and “not ours” are only concepts for peacetime, and during war they lose their meaning” –Ben-Gurion’s War Diary, Vol. 1, entry dated 6 February 1948. p.211

Ben-Gurion also mentioned in his diary:

>“The compulsory transfer of the Arabs... could give us something which we never had...This is national consolidation in an independent homeland.” (Morris, 2004, p. 47) 

And also declared at a congressional meeting:

>“Transfer is what will make possible a comprehensive settlement program. Thankfully, the Arab people have vast empty areas. Jewish power, which grows steadily, will also increase our possibilities to carry out transfer on a large scale.” (Morris, 2004, p. 48)

Yosef Weitz who was the director of the Land and Afforestation Department of the Jewish National Fund and was an avid supporter of forced transfer:

>“Our army is steadily conquering Arab villages and their inhabitants are afraid and fleeing like mice. You have no idea what happened in the Arab villages. It is enough that during the night several shells whistle overhead and they flee for their lives. Villages are steadily emptying, and if we continue on this course–and we shall certainly do so as our strength increases–then tens of villages will empty their inhabitants. This time these self-confident ones, too, will feel what it is like to be refugees. Maybe they will understand us.” (Morris, 2004, p. 243)

By the time things settled in 1949, over 400 Palestinian villages and towns were destroyed or depopulated. About 700,000 Palestinians were displaced from their homes and NOT allowed to return once the fighting ended in an act of massive theft. At this point many can reason that this is all too bad for the Palestinians but the Jews had no choice but to take such measures. According to renown Israeli historian Benny Morris, the offensive which eventually was used to overrun and expel the Arabs was begun due to the fact that Arabs were cutting vital supply lines to Jerusalem and that if the Jews did not go into the offensive eventually they would not be able to hold out forever and perhaps be thrown into the sea. One could make this case. But even if this were true, that the Zionists went on the offensive and ended up depopulating a huge piece of land due to security reasons, Zionist leaders had been looking for the opportunity to transfer Arabs from lands they hoped to have for a future state for a long time and this war was obviously used to achieve this, and no attempts were made to allow people to return to their property. 
 
When David Ben Gurion declared victory and the establishment of Israel in 1949, then US president Harry S. Truman was advised by the State Department and others against recognizing it, but in his how words:

>“I’m sorry, gentlemen, but I have to answer to hundreds of thousands who are anxious for the success of Zionism; I do not have hundreds of thousands of Arabs among my constituents.”

Next let’s quote some leading Zionist keeping in mind that many educated Palestinians and Arab leaders are aware of such statements:

>"The Palestinians are like crocodiles, the more you give them meat, they want more" -- Ehud Barak, Prime Minister of Israel at the time - August 28, 2000. Reported in the Jerusalem Post August 30, 2000.

>"(The Palestinians are) beasts walking on two legs." Menachem Begin, speech to the Knesset, quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk, "Begin and the Beasts". New Statesman, 25 June 1982.

>"When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle." Raphael Eitan, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, New York Times, 14 April 1983.

>"We declare openly that the Arabs have no right to settle on even one centimeter of Eretz Israel... Force is all they do or ever will understand. We shall use the ultimate force until the Palestinians come crawling to us on all fours." Rafael Eitan, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defense Forces - Gad Becker, Yediot Ahronot 13 April 1983, New York Times 14 April 1983.
 
>"How can we return the occupied territories? There is nobody to return them to." Golda Maier, March 8, 1969.

>"There was no such thing as Palestinians, they never existed." Golda Maier Israeli Prime Minister June 15, 1969.

>“We must do everything to insure they never do return. The old will die and the young will forget.” David Ben-Gurion’s Diary, 18 July, 1948, Michael Bar Zohar, Ben-Gurion: The Armed Prophet, 1967).

>"We should prepare to go over to the offensive. Our aim is to smash Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, and Syria. The weak point is Lebanon, for the Moslem regime is artificial and easy for us to undermine. We shall establish a Christian state there, and then we will smash the Arab Legion, eliminate Trans-Jordan; Syria will fall to us. We then bomb and move on and take Port Said, Alexandria and Sinai." David Ben-Gurion, May 1948, to the General Staff. From Ben-Gurion, A Biography, by Michael Ben-Zohar, Delacorte, New York 1978.


>"We walked outside, Ben-Gurion accompanying us. Allon repeated his question, What is to be done with the Palestinian population?' Ben-Gurion waved his hand in a gesture which said 'Drive them out!'" Yitzhak Rabin, leaked censored version of Rabin memoirs, published in the New York Times, 23 October 1979.

>"Spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment... Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly." Theodore Herzl, founder of the World Zionist Organization, speaking of the Arabs of Palestine,Complete Diaries, June 12, 1895 entry.

>"We will establish ourselves in Palestine whether you like it or not...You can hasten our arrival or you can equally retard it. It is however better for you to help us so as to avoid our constructive powers being turned into a destructive power which will overthrow the world." (Chaim Weizmann, Published in "Judische Rundschau," No. 4, 1920).


#### The Zionification of American Christianity and Identity. Right-Wing and Left-Wing Zionism.


Just like 'Zionist Identity' was not popular with Jews at first yet the ideology-identity eventually came to dominate them, the same was the case with Christianity in America. For many American Christians the increasing and somewhat inevitable expansion of a more darwinian worldview, with its increased sexual permissiveness, "flower power", abortion, LGBT, and a perceived "moral decay", which for many can be seen as culminating in the dominance of the despised Hip-Hop culture which I believe played at least a small yet significant factor in getting out the religious vote which helped bring Bush Jr. into office in the year 2000, caused the mindset to became more disillusioned with where the future was heading and began to organize politically and focus more on the shunning of such decadent values and ultimately and most importantly, it began to focus more and more in the afterlife. Simply put, a significant chunk of American Christians believe that the sort of moral decadence we are experiencing is further evidence that we are getting close to experiencing the second coming of Christ, Armageddon, the end of the world and stuff like that. What does this have to do with America’s support for Israel? For people with such views, events like the creation of modern Israel in 1948 and the increasing amount of trouble centered around Israel are further evidence that we are getting nearer to this great battle of good vs. evil which will bring about Christ’s second coming. Bible passages like Luke 21:20 “When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near” are some of the many passages which can help support such “end times” ideologies. Many evangelical Christians who are looking forward to such Armageddon feel like in order to help bring it about and keep the world along such prophetic lines the United States and Christians must continue to support Israel. Whatever their justification for supporting Israel, these people can fall under the label of Christian Zionists which today overwhelmingly dominate American Christianity.

There are Senators like Jim Inhofe(Republican-Okla) who believe that American foreign policy in the Middle East should be based on the Bible. There are the mega-church pastors like John Hagee, the leader of “Christians United for Israel”, who are eagerly awaiting the second coming of Christ and believe that our support of Israel and our meddling in the Middle East must continue in order for this prophesy to come true in the near future. In an interview given by Max Blumenthal of Tom Delay(the former House Majority Leader and therefore top Republican in congress from 2003-2005)  at John Hagee’s “Christians United for Israel Tour” , when asked by Max “How much of an inspiration is the second coming in your support for Israel?” Tom said :

>“Obviously it is what I live for and I hope it comes tomorrow… And obviously we have to be connected to Israel in order to enjoy the second [coming of Christ”.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjMRgT5o-Ig)

More recently, on Sept 20th, 2011 as a Palestinian bid for statehood before the UN once again brought Israel to the forefront, Texas Gov. and one of the leading Republican presidential hopefuls of 2012 Rick Perry stated that:

>“As a Christian I have a clear directive to support Israel, from my perspective it’s pretty easy both as an American and a Christian. I am going to stand with Israel.”

Former 2012 presidential candidate Michele Bachmann mentioned that President Obama’s nuclear negotiations with Iran were accelerating and providing further evidence of Armageddon and the second coming of Christ. Obama later mocked her by saying “Michele Bachmann actually predicted I would bring about the biblical end of days…Now that’s a legacy — that’s big. I mean, Lincoln, Washington — they didn’t do that.”

Although these powerful religious leaders-politicians are often times ignored in the U.S. their anti-Islam and pro-Israel remarks are taken seriously by Islamic clerics and political leaders.

To the aforementioned pro-Israel links between Jews and Zionist Christians one needs to add the cooperation of leading Christian Zionists and Israeli politicians. Menachem Begin had befriended mega pastor Jerry Falwell. Craig Unger writes that “He and Begin got along famously. In 1980, Begin presented Falwell with the prestigious Jabotinsky Award, making him the first gentile to receive it. He gave Falwell’s ministry a private jet.” (Unger, p. 109) Unger again :

>“In 1982, Falwell brought more than three dozen evangelical leaders from the Moral Majority to Israel to foster ties between it and American evangelicals. He cultivated personal friendships and political alliances with Menachem Begin, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Ariel Sharon. Israel gave multimillion-dollar grants to Falwell’s Liberty University, enabling him to bring as many as three thousand students at a time from Liberty University to tour the Holy Land…New travel agencies sponsored Bible Prophecy Tours. Bible tourism soared. Troubled by the fact that many American Jews looked askance at evangelical Christians, in 1983, Rabbi Eckstein founded the Fellowship to bridge the gaps between the two groups and to support Israel…Soon Eckstein found support for the alliance in the Oval Office, where even President Ronald Reagan expressed Christian Zionist sentiments. “You know,” Reagan told Tom Dine, executive director of the powerful Israeli lobbying group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), “I turn back to your ancient prophets in the Old Testament and the signs foretelling Armageddon, and I find myself wondering if we’re the generation that’s going to see that come about.” (Unger, pp. 112-3)

In this match made in heaven between fundamentalist Christian evangelicals and Israeli leaders, who can be said to be making the best use of the other? On the one hand you have American religious leaders who have probably read little outside of the Bible, and on the other you have people like Menachem Begin, who was reading classical literature(in Latin) as a teenager, grew up to survive Soviet gulags, rose to the top of the Irgun and eventually a nation of very smart Jews; and people like Benjamin Netanyahu who has a degree in Architecture from MIT among other accolades. I know such generalization says little, but I believe the Israelis have the upper hand.

On one occasion, unaware of the fact that the camera was rolling, Netanyahu gave away how easy it was to manipulate the American public while talking to some Jewish settlers; part of his conversation went as follows:

Woman: “Aren’t you afraid of the world, Bibi?”
Netanyahu: “Especially today, with America. I know what America is. America is something that can easily be moved. Moved to the right direction.”

Later Netanyahu said:

>“80% of the Americans support us. It’s absurd. We have that kind of support…. Look. That administration [Clinton] was extremely pro-Palestinian. I wasn’t afraid to maneuver there. I was not afraid to clash with Clinton.”

Here Netanyahu is probably referring to negotiations held in early 1998 where he was under pressure from Clinton’s White House to resume peace talks. On the night of January 22nd, Falwell met with Netanyahu and promised him that he would mobilize 200,000 pastors to pressure Clinton and prevent him from pressuring Israel into returning any of the occupied West Bank territory.

More recently, German Prime Minister Angela Merkel mentioned to her cabinet that “every word that leaves Netanyahu’s mouth is a lie.” And unaware that microphones were still listening, French President Nicholas Sarkozy had a dialog with Obama about Netanyahu that went as follows:

Sarkozy: “I cannot stand him. He’s a liar.”
Obama: “You’re fed up with him? I have to deal with him every day.”

Here you have the leaders of the world’s most powerful countries showing their dislike for the leader of a tiny country “whose entire population is less than that of New York City”, yet they are under tremendous pressure to support Netanyahu’s government because as with Catholic mythology in the 1600s, or Socialist mythology in many parts in the 20th century, it is Zionism that the masses believe.  

On April 15th 2011, popular Fox News host Glenn Beck devoted the entire hour of his program to Israel where he rightly brought attention to the importance of this small region of the world. On this particular day one could see the ignorance and naïve good vs. evil thinking which plagues so much of the American public, especially so called “conservatives” who due to their more religious affiliation are more susceptible to "good vs. evil" mentality as already discussed. In his show he had mega pastor and preacher of Armageddon John Hagee and Rabbi Joseph Potasnik who is the executive vice president of the New York Board of Rabbis. Some of the dialog towards the end of program went as follows:

Rabbi Potasnik: "We teach our young people the difference between decency and indecency, evil and good. I simply say: look at what’s going on in the world. Look at Israel. Stand with the good, stand with the decent and let’s stand together."

What is Potasnik implying here? That Palestinians don’t teach their children the difference between decency and indecency? Again, it is that simple, right? Just see some Palestinian blow himself up or throw a rocket and it is obvious who the evil people are, right? I’m not in favor of throwing rockets into Israel like some Palestinians do, but obviously it is absurd to make the naïve good vs. evil distinction this dialog is about without understanding the history and circumstances that create that ‘sequence of thoughts’ which are intertwined with human nature to lead to such actions. But, yet again, as with socialist mythology, the simple and erroneous ideas move faster than the more correct and nuanced understanding. 'Jewish Identity' easily fools itself and then sympathetic supporters. 

Glenn Beck: "It's amazing how clear it is.[Glenn looks at audience and asks them:] Is it clear to everybody, good and evil. And are you amazed? Do you stand next to people and say “what the heck is wrong with you?”

More of the same, this time by Glenn. Next we get a feel for just how powerful and influential this crusade of good vs. evil is:

John Hagee: “In February 2006 we organized Christians United for Israel which is a national Christian organization that now has over 600,000 leaders who once a year go to Washington DC to interact with every senator and congressman on behalf of Israel.”

A few statements later Beck concludes with the following words:

>“There is a clear line between good and evil and it is becoming more clear each and every day. I urge you to do your own homework, find out where the good is and stand there.”

I agree with doing your own homework and standing for what you believe is right, but the problem with the previous dialogue is, again, the naïve good vs. evil mentality that ultimately becomes the lowest common denominator when it comes to segregating masses and getting them ready for mass slaughter. When things look as obvious as good vs. evil it just means that there is tremendous ignorance about the sequences of thoughts and incentives that leads human beings, which for all important purposes are equal, into hating each other and acting the way that they do.

Another great example of the tremendous influence that Zionist mythology has on US politics was on display in late May 2011, when President Obama gave a speech stating that the US supported a 2 state solution where Israel would withdraw to the 1967 border. Immediately Netanyahu and the forces of good(Republicans and their conservative-religious flock), decried Obama’s statements. Fox news showed video of an old Palestinian woman who said that God had brought the Jews to Israel so that they could all be slaughtered. A few days later Netanyahu gave a speech rebuking Obama’s statements which was interrupted by applause 56 times and had 26 standing ovations. Three-time member of the Israeli Knesset(Israel's congress) as well as former Irgun member who admits he used to be a terrorist, Uri Avnery, commented on the tremendous praise and standing ovations Netanyahu got while addressing congress:

>“What the American Senators and Congressmen feared was a fate worse than death. Anyone remaining seated or not applauding wildly enough could have been caught on camera – and that amounts to political suicide. It was enough for one single congressman to rise and applaud, and all the others had to follow suit. Who would dare not to?”

And yet another example is how in the summer of 2011, 81 congressmen will be visiting Israel on trips paid for by the American Israel Education Foundation. As Stephen  M. Walt writes “That’s right: during the August recess nearly a fifth of the U.S. Congress will visit a single country whose entire population is less than that of New York City”. 

Thus the way Zionist ideology has evolved every political ape in his quest to be a great leader for the forces of good vs. evil eventually makes a trip to Israel where the 'good vs. evil' ideology and fallacies understandably burn at their brightest and comes back inspired-transformed, ready to do his moral duty of voting Yes to every 'aid package' for Israel, or to attack any regime critical of it, or to pass more 'hate speech' laws as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis did on the usual ritualistic trip to Israel on late April 2023.

Why do they do this?  Is it because there is some massive conspiracy by Jews to run the world like it might seem to many, especially some Arabs? Of course not, these things "are indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design".

Let’s fast-forward to the Trump Presidency. For example, Mike Pompeo, former head of the CIA and Secretary of State, is a very religious evangelical Christian who is a cookie-cutter example of the Christian ‘Neocon’ mindset, and Yossi Cohen, the head of Mossad, is a likewise religious Orthodox Jew. These men are like best friends in their battle of ‘good vs. evil’. Pompeo writes in his book, aptly titled ‘Never Give an Inch’:

>“Being men of deep faith also solidified our bonds. Yossi and his wife, Aya, are Orthodox Jews. As evangelical Christians, Susan and I understood that our tradition wasn’t just Christian—it was Judeo-Christian. Yossi and I each understood the importance of Israel within our respective faith traditions and why this remarkable land was worth fighting to preserve. Talking with Yossi helped me realize, contrary to the later baying of the media hounds, that being open about my faith life didn’t scuttle my efforts on behalf of America—it strengthened them. Our abiding respect for one another flowed directly from talking about our imperfect, lifelong journey to honor God.”

Pompeo, leading the charge of the forces of ‘good vs. evil’, sees the Iranian government as pure evil and anyone who sees things differently is engaging in ‘sheer madness’. He writes:

>“The Iranian regime is a de facto terrorist group....the Obama administration's overeducated liberals.... decided that they knew better and sought to cut a deal with Iran. They believed that they could transform due-hard Islamists into responsible partners in peace...It was sheer madness.”

Some of these ‘overeducated liberals’ are just non-religious non-naïve ‘good vs. evil’ thinkers who believe all homo sapiens can eventually overcome misunderstandings and have peace, but of course, this is ‘sheer madness’. Pompeo understandably radiates the ‘good vs. evil’, with-us or against-us tribalistic mentality in all directions with his hatred of famed journalists and whistleblowers Julian Assange and Edward Snowden whom he referred to as ‘simple hoodlums’ and writes:

>"villains such as Assange...Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning...They certainly aren't journalists. If they are foreigners, they are enemies. If they are Americans, they are traitors.... These crooks claim to be honoring human rights and free expression. They are in fact serving the interests of the most evil and repressive regimes... These enemies and traitors must be punished... I pursued Assange's extradition hard as CIA director and secretary of state.... I lobbied the Ecuadorians to kick Assange out of his pathetic accommodations inside their embassy, and they finally capitulated...I will be delighted the day he is thrown into an American federal penitentiary. Just one less useful idiot free for Russia to exploit-and a warning to all such scoundrels in the future."

In the naïve battle of ‘good vs. evil’, your side of homo sapiens can never do any wrong. He writes:

>“I was right in that waterboarding worked. And the CIA men and women who were tasked with collecting intelligence....operate with the highest respect for the law.”

Below we see Iraqis mistreated at the Abu Ghraib prison by the forces of good. 
<img src="../../images/abu.jpg" alt="Americans abusing Iraqi prisoners"
	title="Money Growth" width="500" height="500" />

To a naïve ‘good vs. evil’ thinker like Pompeo the immense complexities and history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be described as:

>“This land, as an evangelical Christian, I am convinced from my reading of the Bible that 3,000 years onto now, in spite of the denial of so many, is the rightful homeland of the Jewish people,”

And of course Pompeo sees Putin and the Russians, who treats the Syrians and Iranians as fellow homo sapiens instead of some ‘evildoers’, as “a very smart, bad guy....Putin and his ilk are constantly looking to weaken our defenses and split our alliances.” And so the battle of ‘good vs. evil’ continues.

Compare the above simple-minded 'good vs. evil', 'us vs. them' mindset of Pompeo, to the wise and profound Assange. When talking about naive tribalistic politicians like Hillary, Trump, Pompeo and the US administration who want to kill him, he mentions the following:

>"Yes, of course there’s groupism operating and probably opportunism as well. But, you know, I don’t think you can cast these people as devils at all. These are people with a range of noble and ignoble character traits. They’re human beings. And they have a worldview, and it really is a worldview. They exist within a particular information sphere, which I find fairly confining and self-referential, and believe some weird things. But I think that’s a product of the information that they receive, their upbringing, their — you know, the networks who are keeping them in a particular bubble. And I don’t think it’s because, with some exceptions, that they are intrinsically bad human beings.

Assange is of course very well aware of the monumental error-disaster that Zionism has been. He mentions way back in 2016, commenting on how the Zionist error leads to Russia being seen as some evil due to good relations with Syria thus predicting the current Russia-Ukraine war:

"Russian actions on its own doorstep in Eastern Europe do not in fact threaten the United States or any actual vital interest. Nor does Moscow threaten the U.S. through its intervention on behalf of the Syrian government in the Middle East. That Russia is described incessantly as a threat in those areas is largely a contrivance arranged by the media, the Democratic and Republican National Committees and by the White House...there is, however, another country that has interfered in U.S. elections, has endangered Americans living or working overseas and has corrupted America’s legislative and executive branches. It has exploited that corruption to initiate legislation favorable to itself, has promoted unnecessary and unwinnable wars and has stolen American technology and military secrets. Its ready access to the mainstream media to spread its own propaganda provides it with cover for its actions and it accomplishes all that and more through the agency of a powerful and well-funded domestic lobby that oddly is not subject to the accountability afforded by the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) of 1938 even though it manifestly works on behalf of a foreign government. That country is, of course, Israel".

Thus, of course, Assange is an enemy and a traitor... 

In order for the Zionist mythology to continue, at least in its current form, it needs more negligence, ignorance, force, and ultimately influence in the USA and other countries that provide the massive military, financial, and intellectual aid that helped create and keeps the error going. Little by little, if there is freedom and emergent 'competitive knowledge discovery', the intellectual errors and myths of Zionism, as with Communism, are overcome. A recent Gallup study revealed that the average Democratic Party voter in the USA now has more sympathy for the Palestinian views (49%) than the [Zionist views (38%).](https://news.gallup.com/poll/472070/democrats-sympathies-middle-east-shift-palestinians.aspx). The study mentions that "Republicans’ views are unchanged, with nearly eight in 10 (78%) continuing to sympathize more with the Israelis while 11% side with the Palestinians." This makes perfect sense, per above, the more religious Republican Party masses are easily persuaded to side with the white, Ashkenazi Jews, but not so much the Democrats-Left. 



The above religious-based Zionism can be seen as 'Right-Wing' Zionism. The Zionism of the US Republican Party and the naive simple-minded flag-waving white American Christian masses who easily find unity with fellow white-European Ashkenazi Jews like Netanyahu. But we also have Left-Wing Zionism, the Zionism of the Left, of the secular intellectuals, the 'Priesthood of Scientism', and so on. These are the enlightened very successful secular Jews and their similarly-minded intellectuals who see the Muslim world as religious fanatics and fellow secular Jews-Israelis as the good and "civilized" people.
