##### The Infectious Myth 

This section is dedicated to the memory of the great researcher [David Crowe](https://david-crowe-podcast.s3.amazonaws.com/index.htm)

The spectacular CovidTyranny mankind has recently experienced has had the inadvertent positive effect of getting countless minds to notice just how misguided mainstream medicine can be. To at least some degree Robert Kennedy Jr's book, "The Real Anthony Fauci", being a #1 bestseller on Amazon.com for nearly 2 months, and long after publication a still-bestseller in numerous science-related categories thus an obvious eye-sore to the medical Priesthood, is akin to Martin Luther's "95 Theses" document which sparked the Protestant Revolution and thus a massive change in the mythology of the times. Sixty percent of the book's content deals with the HIV->Death myth, the Fauci-Pope, and essentially the growth and functioning of the Medical Priesthood of Scientism. The vast majority of slightly smarter apes understandably just go along with Fauci's Priesthood as did the masses go along with the Pope's Crusades, but the sheer obvious stupidity of the lockdowns and coerced vaccinations, especially of kids, has greatly accelerated the rate at which that 2-3% of the population that actually reads books and can think a bit more independently is waking up to the fact that so much of mainstream medicine is nonsense and run by incompetent bureucrats. 

Given the above, as many are questioning the intellectual foundations from which so much nonsense and tyranny is arising, they are stumbling upon various potential Galileos who may ultimately be right when they question the entire paradigm of 'Infectious Diseases' and thus the very existence of pathogenic viruses. We have already discussed how diseases are due to biochemical breakdowns which can be caused by numerous things like improper nutrition and toxins, but what about harmful germs and viruses? The myth that there is some contagious agent is one that the slightly smarter apes understandably fall for over and over. For example, for many centuries 'Miasma Theory' was the leading medical myth. People believed that a sort of foul air spread disease. Since many diseases cause people to get sick at around the same time some infectious agent would make sense. They had no idea how shared lack of nutrients or filth and unsanitary conditions could also be a cause. Once the slightly smarter apes stumbled upon microscopes and discovered bacteria, especially when similar-looking bacteria appeared in diseased tissue, voilà! it is the bacteria! It is totally understandable how slightly smarter apes with a new scientific toy could make such errors. It would be foolish to say that firemen who usually appear when a home is on fire are the cause of the fire. Firemen are the result, not the cause, of the fire. Similarly, the overgrowth of certain bacteria is the result of the disease or biochemical breakdown but NOT the cause. For example, many people can be found with Streptococcus bacteria which is blamed for 'strep throat' yet they don't get the disease. 

Animals like human beings have co-evolved and are dependent on bacteria for their very existence. In experiments where mice are kept as sterile as possible they quickly die. We are just beginning to understand that vital role that the 'microbiome' plays. Bacteria are not "conscious", and much less choosing predation as a way to prosper. Natural Selection selects for order AND cooperation because that is what leads to the most order relative to less cooperation. Let's assume a purely pathogenic bacteria exits which prays on a healthy animal tissue, this would cause the animal to be outcompeted by other animals that didn't have such a dangerous bacteria causing the bacteria itself to be naturally selected against. Thus the bacteria that exist, exist because they are part of the complex environments that sustain the various organisms that ultimately provide the nutrients-wealth they need to sustain their order. It is true that sometimes an overgrowth of bacteria can lead to death and thus make antibiotics life-saving drugs, but this does not change the fundamental fact that the bacteria were NOT the root cause of the disease. Bacteria become overabundant in dead or diseased tissue not because they have "overcome our defenses" implying some constant battle, but because the diseased tissue essentially changes in a manner where it becomes natural or easy for the bacteria to now decompose it. Animals do not have "immune systems" that are fighting defensive battles, we have order-restoring systems which of course often-times have to deal with bacteria which inadvertently find-themselves munching on the wrong stuff. Again, natural selection selects for ORDER, for incorporating inanimate matter into life-order. Predation of course is an evolved strategy which leads to order, but when cooperation and symbiosis is possible and can lead to more order, then that is what is naturally selected as we have seen in our planet. The very emergence of the 'market process' and 'Social Organism' is yet another example. Another and superior mechanism for creating order has arisen, and instead of predation-war we are being naturally selected when we have peace and cooperation. As crazy as this may sound, no one has been able to prove the transmissibility of disease via bacteria or viruses which we turn to next.

Let us bring attention to the famed "Rosenau Spanish Flu Experiments (1918)". We quote from "The State of Science, Microbiology, and Vaccines [Circa 1918" by John M. Eyler, PhD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2862332/#!po=60.7527) which we found in Mike Stone's awesome website [viroliegy.com](viroliegy.com):

>"Perhaps the most interesting epidemiological studies conducted during the 1918–1919 pandemic were the human experiments conducted by the Public Health Service and the U.S. Navy under the supervision of Milton Rosenau on Gallops Island, the quarantine station in Boston Harbor, and on Angel Island, its counterpart in San Francisco. The experiment began with 100 volunteers from the Navy who had no history of influenza. Rosenau was the first to report on the experiments conducted at Gallops Island in November and December 1918. His first volunteers received first one strain and then several strains of Pfeiffer's bacillus by spray and swab into their noses and throats and then into their eyes. When that procedure failed to produce disease, others were inoculated with mixtures of other organisms isolated from the throats and noses of influenza patients. Next, some volunteers received injections of blood from influenza patients. Finally, 13 of the volunteers were taken into an influenza ward and exposed to 10 influenza patients each. Each volunteer was to shake hands with each patient, to talk with him at close range, and to permit him to cough directly into his face. None of the volunteers in these experiments developed influenza. Rosenau was clearly puzzled, and he cautioned against drawing conclusions from negative results. He ended his article in JAMA with a telling acknowledgement: “We entered the outbreak with a notion that we knew the cause of the disease, and were quite sure we knew how it was transmitted from person to person. Perhaps, if we have learned anything, it is that we are not quite sure what we know about the disease.”

>The research conducted at Angel Island and that continued in early 1919 in Boston broadened this research by inoculating with the Mathers streptococcus and by including a search for filter-passing agents, but it produced similar negative results. It seemed that what was acknowledged to be one of the most contagious of communicable diseases could not be transferred under experimental conditions."

What about transmission of regular flu in modern times?

>"Our review found no human experimental studies published in the English-language literature delineating person-to-person [transmission of influenza."](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/37/8/1094/2013282?login=false)

Rhinovirus?

>“Extensive human rhinovirus transmission experiments have not led to a widely-accepted view on the [transmission route"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625717301773#bib0880)

Coronavirus?

>"Unfortunately, there is very little data to corroborate on the HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 transmission [routes."](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102683/)

MERS?

>"To date, there is little data on the human-to-human MERS-CoV [transmission route"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625717301773#bib1120)

Over and over and over, when good science and reason is applied, no concrete evidence of transmission of alleged viral or bacterial diseases can be proven.


As the apes with microscopes and newly-discovered bacteria were inadvertently growing their "Priesthood of Scientism" and "Scientists" were becoming the new all-powerful Priests, they realized many people were sick but they could not find bacteria to associate with the sickness so they cleverly assumed something smaller than a bacteria must be the contagious agents. Those clever apes! Thus, before having the ability to filter and much less see them, the mythical pathogenic virus expanded in the minds of scientists. For a while they thought viruses were proteins, but then... drumroll please...the apes got a new toy, the electron microscope, which allowed them to notice smaller things, which of course, had to be the pathogenic critters. As Science in general was growing at the expense of Religion, the public understandably saw bright and accomplished scientists as the new wise leaders and it became increasingly desirable for the Public-Faithful and thus politicians to give more money to this growing "Priesthood of Scientism". Government "investing in science", in other words, coercively redistributing wealth from the free and competitive private sector to a competition-immune Priesthood of slightly smarter apes became an increasingly popular belief which still haunts us today. Once again the slightly smarter apes gave credit to some apes-'great scientists' or growing bureaucracy-Priesthood instead of freedom's emerging 'competitive knowledge discovery' or 'the market process' which is what was actually creating and spreading all the technology, information, and wealth necessary make rapid progress. As government investment grows the 'Priesthood of Scientism', young scientists are more motivated to inadvertently join it (which is of course always one breakthrough away from amazing cures) than they are in debunking bad science at their own expense. Who joins the Catholic Church to criticize its myths? Who wants to be the scientist-Priest that puts an end to the comfortable Scientist-Priest life by getting government to shut down the nearly $35 billion spent yearly in HIV research? This is a job for the Galileos and dissenters which brings us to the story of "The Perth Group" and Dr. Stefan Lanka.
