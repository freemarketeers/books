### Early Cultural Evolution : Names, Self, Identity, Language and Reason.

When-how did we begin "naming" people which would bring a tremendous advantage for group cooperation. Associating ideas-language with the concept of the "self"? And linking the "self" with group-religious-tribal identities which was vital for group-tribal cohesion in war-conquest-defense-survival? The farther back in time we go, the more ethnocentric-tribalistic our ideologies-identities were. A tribe-group that didn't have such strong us vs. them mentality would be outcompeted in war-offence-defense and be naturally selected out of existence thus what remained-existed in our tribal past was strong ethnocentrism. These vital early cultural concepts-software are neither "in our genes", and also "do not prove to be the result of an intention aimed at this purpose, i.e., the result of an agreement of members of society" [(Menger)](https://books.google.com/books?id=3NdnezJePIQC&pg=PA130&lpg=PA130&dq=result+of+an+intention+aimed+at+this+purpose,+i.e.,+the+result+of+an+agreement+of+members+of+society&source=bl&ots=UC_E8u_fPu&sig=ACfU3U13Jzkf_em3RgupNaY7li841zhG9w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjnzteF5_7mAhXiNX0KHXFKBVwQ6AEwAHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=result%20of%20an%20intention%20aimed%20at%20this%20purpose%2C%20i.e.%2C%20the%20result%20of%20an%20agreement%20of%20members%20of%20society&f=false), they were designed-refined by competition between groups. Most slightly smarter apes still place great emphasis on their "identity" as Jews, Christians, Muslims, etc., sometimes leading to understandable yet disastrous results as will be discussed later. Obviously it only takes a few seconds to come to the realization that whatever "identity"-religion one identifies with is purely based on luck-circumstance and having grown up among fellow slightly smarter apes that raise us identifying as such. 

What about human "reason"? It too has far more to do with cultural evolution than most realize. Imagine the following cruel scenario. A baby is taken from his mother at birth and raised by plain-looking mechanical arms. No human being looks at him in the eyes implying that there is a "self" behind them. He never sees his own reflection, is never spoken to and thus never picks up a language which is crucial for thinking. For example, Mises writes:

>"Thought is bound up with speech. The thinker's conceptual edifice is built on the elements of language. The human mind works only in language; it is by the Word that it first breaks through from the obscurity of uncertainty and the vagueness of instinct to such clarity as it can ever hope to attain. Thinking and that which is thought cannot be detached from the language to which they owe their origin." [(Mises, "Socialism")](https://www.econlib.org/book-chapters/chapter-part-iiich-19/)

How would this unfortunate person "think" as an adult regardless of how powerful the brain and what it gets purely from genetics? Hayek writes:

>"It may well be asked whether an individual who did not have the opportunity to tap such cultural tradition could be said even to have a mind" (Hayek, "The Fatal Conceit")

Hazlitt tells us:

>“[referring to man in general]He could not think at all(or only at the level of a chimpanzee) if he did not inherit from the society and civilization in which he was born the priceless gift of an already created language. Without this he would not only be unable to reason logically, he would have nothing worthy to be called a “concept”. He could not frame a sentence; he could not even name things. We think in words, even in conversations. Our language, concepts, and logic are part of the social inheritance of all of us”… “As the great nineteenth-century philologist Max Mueller put it: “To think is to speak low. To speak is to think aloud”. The corollary of this is tremendously important. A man with a scant vocabulary will almost certainly be a weak thinker. The richer and more copious one’s vocabulary and the greater one’s awareness of the fine distinctions and subtle nuances of meaning, the more fertile and precise is likely to be one’s thinking. Knowledge of things and knowledge of the words for them grow together. If you do not know the words, you can hardly know the thing. We are told that the Tasmanian method of counting is: “One, two, plenty.” This points to a very significant truth. Man could not even count, certainly not beyond the number of fingers on his hands, until he had invented names and symbols for numbers. For in speaking of the need for language for thought, we must, of course, include symbols as an integral part of language. It is amazing how recent in human history are even the Arabic numerals, the denary system, and elementary signs for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division…” [(Hazlitt, p. 51)](https://books.google.com/books?id=Fg17rGu02OsC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=%22we+must,+of+course,+include+symbols+as+an+integral+part+of+language.+It+is+amazing+how+recent+in+human%22&source=bl&ots=et5ThYpIAD&sig=ACfU3U01xzGqF-8xroN4OY590Eia24Q9Eg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj61IDk--LsAhWypFkKHQicCCsQ6AEwAHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=%22we%20must%2C%20of%20course%2C%20include%20symbols%20as%20an%20integral%20part%20of%20language.%20It%20is%20amazing%20how%20recent%20in%20human%22&f=false)

My guess is that a bonobo-ape, raised among humans and taught some rudimentary sign language would act far, far more reasonably than this "culture-software-less" person. And again, what is the process that designs those things like language, religions and 'the market process' which "are indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design"(Ferguson)? Natural Selection-competition via Hayek's 'group selection'.

Knowing that 'private property' is the simple concept-institution that leads to a chain-reaction of incentives which creates the Social Organism, we can easily see that those tribes-orders whose customs-religions inadvertently became more peaceful and thus less violent, extended peace-friendship-trade to those outside the tribe, etc., in other words, those who tended to respect 'private property' and thus individual freedom more and more, would become more technologically advanced-powerful, and as they grew, they would inadvertently spread the very customs (increasing respect for private property, tolerance, and commercial culture that emerges from it) and evolving economic system (market process-capitalism) that allowed them to reach such relative heights. Once again, the true sort of 'designer' of the market process was our old friend 'natural selection'-competition acting on groups-cultures, inadvertently selecting those customs-ideologies-concepts as if they were genes. 


An example of this process was the Protestant Reformation. For centuries the Catholic Church’s traditions-myths held immense coercive-monopoly-competitionless power which prevented-retarded individual freedom and resulting ‘competitive knowledge discovery’. In the early 1500s Martin Luther preached that a person could be saved by believing in Christ without the Catholic Church’s approval, and that the Bible itself, not the Pope-Church’s edicts-interpretations, was what mattered. This helped reduce-eliminate the coercive-monopoly power of the Church and spark a pro-freedom and thus emergent ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ that would lead to skyrocketing rates of innovation-production-prosperity per graph below.

Now, very important! Did Martin Luther reason that his religious interpretations would accelerate ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ leading to our relatively advanced civilization? Of course not! Again, just like solitary cells millions of years ago inadvertently created the respiratory-circulatory-nervous-etc. “systems” that led to multicellular organisms without ‘designing them’, so is ‘the market process’-Capitalism “indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design”. The ‘market process’-Capitalism is mankind’s greatest invention, yet it was not “the execution of any human design” and emerged “as unintended results of historical development” !!!!

Great (and dangerous to even discuss) examples of cultural evolution are circumcision and age of sexual consent. Circumcision is a physically dangerous and truly cruel and barbaric practice, yet somehow it emerged and is still practiced by millions of very educated Jews and Muslims. The "reason" of the increasingly dominant Darwinian mindset in countries like Germany and Iceland via government coercion have attempted to ban it. Whatever potential benefits (if any) circumcision may have provided are as difficult to discover as the evolutionary pressures millions of years ago that led to the evolution of certain genes. Again, groups of homo sapiens are naturally selected primarily based on how productive and technologically advanced they become relative to others, and cultural values that encouraged production and large populations have been selected over leisure, voilence and our animalistic sexual instincts, thus it is understandable how age of consent laws and norms have been pushed higher. If an 11 year old voluntarily performs some sexual act with an adult, and even more shocking, does so for money, this is considered a major crime and horror given how allowing such a voluntary practice would affect the functioning of the current order. Notice how the truly barbaric practice of circumcision is generally allowed, yet the above voluntary exchange is vilified and criminalized. Why? Again, cultural evolution, not "reason", is what has evolved the rules and ideologies that create our social order.
