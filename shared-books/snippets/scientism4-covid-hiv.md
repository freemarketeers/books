##### The Coronavirus Ape Self-Mutilation and the similarity to HIV->AIDS->DEATH mythology

Much of what is related to the Coronavirus, from the "science" to the resulting lockdowns and socioeconomic chaos, is essentially mythology that arises due to the complexity of biochemistry and perverse incentives leading to central-planning-like Communism and should be analyzed similarly. Again, in just the last 300 years mankind has been mired in religious slaughters, two massive world wars, the rise of Communism, etc. that are ultimately rooted in myth, religious myths, economic myths, etc. All backed by the "experts" of their day. Myths that inadvertently motivate the slightly smarter apes into creating competitionless-coercive bureaucracies that paralyze-destroy the social order in various ways. None of the previous disasters would have occurred if people had not been coerced into the ideologies and government-central plans of the times. Once again, freedom shields people from doing something they don't want to do, AND!! also leads to 'competitive knowledge discovery' which is the ultimate way to discover the best information with which to create superior products, order mankind, and discover THE TRUTH!, which obviously includes "the science"!. And the more complex the subject matter is (like medicine), the more freedom and competition is needed. Regarding Covidmania we have the opposite of 'competitive knowledge discovery' in both the biochemical order as massive competition-immune coercive government regulatory bodies like the AMA, CDC and WHO dictate what is "the science", as well as disastrous interventions-destruction of the socioeconomic order via lockdowns, travel restrictions, coerced vaccinations, etc. leading to the nearly Bolshevik Revolution-like tyranny that gripped the world for 3 years.

Let us see how the slightly smarter apes with electron microscopes have let the complexity of the biological order further motivate them into the disastrous-coercive-'central planning' they always fall for.

Although plenty of people knew that the mortality due to Covid19 was going to be on par with that of a regular-strong flu from the minute the mania and lockdowns started just like plenty of people knew that Communism was bound to be an unworkable disaster, by mid 2020 enough data and related research had been done to make this obvious to anyone curious enough and able to trust his reason more than what clueless politicians and Anthony Fauci were saying. In March 2020, even Anthony Fauci had published a paper at the New England Journal of Medicine stating that "the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of [approximately 0.1%)."](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejme2002387) Great free-market think-tanks like the ["American Institute for Economic Research"](https://www.aier.org/) were able to coordinate intellectual opposition to the CovidMania lockdown-restrictions via their ["Great Barrington Declaration"](https://gbdeclaration.org/) where thousands of highly accredited and respected scientists from all over the world lent their names to such criticisms. A simple comparison between Sweden which did relatively little compared to the USA and other countries easily showed how masks and lockdowns were counter-productive or hardly any better at best. But just like with Communism and the night-time North-South Korea comparison, even though for decades one could easily see how the non-Communist countries were doing much better, once the ideological and incentive structure began to take shape, simple reason could do little to get in its way. For decades Communist ideologues-theologians and their evolved 'echo chambers' had their various explanations as to why they remained behind the freer-Capitalist countries, just like the pro-mask-lockdown-CovidVaccine ideologues justify their fallacies. We are also just dealing with largely uneducated masses who are understandingly scared, and many who also just refuse to admit they were wrong.

CovidMania was-is essentially what is being called a "Casedemic", botched science at numerous levels leading to false positive tests, fueling a hysteria, and very very very important, an incentive structure, that just like with Lenin's Bolshevik Communist revolution, motivates many people to grow-join central planning-regulating-paralyzing bureaucracies especially when government began to pay more money for [Covid19 treatments-tests-vaccines-drugs-etc.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/) and started sending people checks-money so they could take a vacation and continue to consume wealth without having to work-produce due to lockdowns. Remember that the medical sector has gone from about 4% of economy in 1960s to about 20% now, and it is incentivized to grow in revenue in order to heroically protect us from the killer pandemic. Public sector bureaucracies like public education and college professors ("experts") also don't have any 'skin in the game' and are not affected by lockdowns since they get their wealth from coercive taxation. So one has a massive amount of the population with a pro-lockdown incentive structure.

CovidMania could also be seen as a repeat of the 1976 'Swine Flu' scare, where, as wonderfully summarized by this 15 minute ['60 Minutes' TV segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bOHYZhL0WQ), a similar combination of botched 'science', perverse financial incentives, and the ever-present competition-immune-government coercion which enables all the inferior decision-making led to a 'Swine Flu' scare where millions of Americans (25%) got what was eventually clearly understood as a poisonous vaccine. The vaccination program was stopped after just 25 deaths from Guillain-Barre syndrome were tied to the vaccine. In 1976 a far smaller percentage of the US population worked in the medical bureucracy, Americans at the time were also far more religious and more likely to have a stronger outrage give fewer deaths, and also newspapers were more independent and really interested in exposing inappropriate behaviour, unlike today, where most are significantly dependent on pharmaceutical industry revenue.

US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) personnel knew early on that the Covid tests were faulty and would lead to many false positives [but they kept quiet.](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/06/929078678/cdc-report-officials-knew-coronavirus-test-was-flawed-but-released-it-anyway) Again, this does not have to be seen as some massive conspiracy, it could have been negligence by a few bad-apple-scientists who knew the coming panic would bring them additional funds-business, it could have also been what is referred to as a "Noble Lie", where people with good intentions commit a fraud or go along with a little white lie or exaggeration if they feel like it will help people in general (and also happens to improve your finance). Perhaps some felt like the eventual exaggeration of the danger would motivate people to be extra careful and help "save more lives". There is no need to even lie a bit, why not make it clear to the government and public that this "could potentially" be very bad and just out of caution we need more money for research. Just like the firefighter that daydreams of being a hero and valiantly running into danger to save people needs a fire, and a soldier who daydreams of courageously killing the enemy while saving his fellow countrymen needs a war, so do some "disease experts" and numerous economically ignorant ideologues look forward to some calamity so they can be heroes and also blame everything on the capitalism-freedom('selfishness') they don't understand and want an opportunity to socially engineer society "for the greater good". There is the petri dish of 'scientists' with various levels of honesty leading to honest errors, charlatans, and negligence, and eventually the statistical certainty that exaggerations will explode into a government-funded chain-reaction of mania and government growth. Again! It is vitally important that we see the formation of disastrous 'central planning structures' as complex ideological factors-incentives instead of a "conspiracy"-"hoax".


This and numerous other factors led people who obviously died of old age and other co-morbidities to be labeled as having died due to Covid helping fuel the mania. For example, in [Italy](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Report-COVID-2019_20_marzo_eng.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2xLHsmL_R3vKjoUOonuu5sUPZiB0VB2xH3k3vI7tq3o8cShnwTeWXNhYM), which was a hotbed of hysteria, the average age of people who died and had the virus was 78 years old, and on average people had almost 3 other diseases. It is also important to notice how many were taking all kinds of drugs whose side-effects are often-times what kills them, especially more dangerous anti-viral drugs etc. In [England figures have been similar](https://news.sky.com/video/covid-19-how-do-figures-of-virus-deaths-compare-to-a-normal-year-11964813?fbclid=IwAR2b7ifXRjnbt-eL8oBPLeUhgYj6kLHK5BKNG5xXwrMtq8VXcQ4SATJ1dBo), 98% were elderly with other medical conditions. Their "experts" and their mythical models quickly had to revise predictions from about 500,000 deaths to only 20,000 out of a total population of 56 million people, yet they also wisely estimated that 2/3 of those people would have died anyway from some other cause leading to an estimate of about 6-10K deaths due to virus for the year. Random testing for antibodies which show up after people have been infected with the potential pathogen have shown that the pathogen has already affected way more people than originally thought and that the rate of mortality is is closer to [0.12-0.2%](https://reason.com/2020/04/17/covid-19-lethality-not-much-different-than-flu-says-new-study/) which makes it similar to regular flu (0.1%). The PCR based test that is being used to identify cases comes back positive if it finds a piece of the virus that came from an antibody of someone who already dealt with the pathogen thus helping fuel the covidmania. Yet with all of this evidence, Fauci and his counterparts in much of the world continued to believe-preach that we must have lockdowns and eventual vaccines in order to be better off, in other words, they are pushing "a widely held but false belief or idea", a myth. A myth far more dangerous than praying to some likely inexistent deity. What we really want is for the immune system that natural selection has been perfecting for over a billion years and our "experts" still hardly really understand, to work optimally which it can only do in a body that is free from disease and has been fed the optimal diet-fuel which helps explain why truly healthy people, even among the relatively old, rarely succumb to the Coronavirus pathogen. 



According to *alleged* immunology 101 mythology, viruses infect us and attempt to use our own cells to make copies of themselves, eventually our defenses fight off the infection and remember the genetic sequence of the virus so they can no longer attack us in the future. A new "novel" virus initially has a large population to infect, but as an increasing amount of members have fought off the infection we develop "herd immunity" and the virus has less potential hosts to infect and use for replication so it tends to disappear. This is more or less the common understanding of what millions of years of natural selection has crafted in ways we are just beginning to understand(which given the complexity may be erroneous as we will soon discuss). The whole idea behind vaccines is that by injecting ourselves with a dead or somehow less potentially dangerous-virulent version of the pathogen we can sort of "trick" the body into creating the antibodies which will then properly prevent the live or more dangerous version of the pathogen, which as already discussed may actually do more harm than good and be unnecessary-detrimental. 

The aforementioned ["Great Barrington Declaration"](https://gbdeclaration.org/) which was signed by thousands of top scientists helps us maximize our highly evolved immune system while using scientific interventions when needed-useful. It is very short and most of its recommendations are:

>"Fortunately, our understanding of the virus is growing. We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young. Indeed, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza. 

>As immunity builds in the population, the risk of infection to all – including the vulnerable – falls. We know that all populations will eventually reach herd immunity – i.e.  the point at which the rate of new infections is stable – and that this can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine. Our goal should therefore be to minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity. 

>The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We call this Focused Protection. 

>Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity."

Again... Using our understanding of the "science" we want to let the herd immunity that has been crafted by natural selection for millions of years to do its thing. It is totally UNNATURAL and against the acquired wisdom and disease fighting ability of millions or years of natural selection to go AGAINST this by locking away all human beings, including the young who have virtually 0 chance of dying from covid, and making people depressed prisoners eating garbage food and ultimately getting sicker in countless ways and creating an economic damage none of the bureaucrats or even mainstream economists can understand since they are clueless money-creating Keynesians.


Just like in the Soviet Union people like Trofim Lysenko would rise to the top, we see the same thing in national monopolies like in the USA with Anthony Fauci(more about this soon) and in the World Health Organization via its top bureaucrat Tedros Ghebreyesus who said the following absurdity regarding herd immunity:

>"Herd immunity is a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached … Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing [them to it."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrington_Declaration#Reception)

The above shows complete ignorance of herd immunity and basic immunology. It is by being exposed to a virus and building natural immunity to it via the creation of antibodies-etc., which is what vaccines attempt to replicate, that we supposedly attempt to create herd immunity. Tedros' new statement-definition of "the science" has now been adopted by the WHO, and replaces the older and more correct meaning which rightly incorporated natural infection as can be seen in image below:


<img src="../../images/who-herd.jpg" alt="WHO on herd immunity"
	title="WHO on herd immunity" width="350" height="500" />


Anthony Fauci did not recognize or try to engage the thousands of leading scientist who signed the [Great Barrington Declaration(GBD)](https://gbdeclaration.org/), in good tribal-political ape manner, just like Communist ideologues (as well as Church when it had all the power) tend to do, he simply called the declaration ["ridiculous", "total nonsense" and "very dangerous"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrington_Declaration#Reception), saying that it would lead to a large number of avoidable deaths. Dismissing so many world-renowned scientists in such a manner without curious and welcoming dialog, is really all one needs to know in order to realize that Fauci has Lysenko-like 'cognitive dissonance'. Communists, in their self-reinforcing "echo chamber" would simply see free-marketeers as callous people who wanted to "exploit" the masses and so on, "unscientific religious people" who blindly followed supposedly absurd religious concepts, etc. and we similarly see mainstream press and "scientists" smear the GBD as some "right-wing" political creation. However, it is once again vitally important that we see these phenomena not as the result of 100% purposeful malice, but out of a certain cognitive dissonance-bias or understandable lack of care for different views or the true extent of harm caused by potentially looking the other way. For example Fauci and the "scientific experts" can always point to some very religious persons talking about wild conspiracies by the "devil" or some carefully orchestrated "hoax"-"conspiracy" trying to defend their freedom to not go along the plans of the "fauci-scientists-experts" as some nuts that need to be ignored or coerced for their own good or "the good of society". So we can easily see how the various 'echo chambers' can form-spread-intensify their polarization. Again, complex ideological factors and incentive structures can lead to concerted action which should not be confused with a "conspiracy" or "hoax". We want to focus on how the ideas, the 'echo chambers' and the 'incentive structures' arise-evolve, instead of on particular individuals. In such structures since there are so many people involved it would be easy to find people with all sorts of motives, from truly well-intentioned-concerned, to 100% malicious charlatans, and it would be a gigantic error to label all of CovidMania based on one-few individuals. Again, just like religious wars of the past, you had plenty of truly faithful and you had some focused on pure territorial gain-etc. and complex mixtures in-between.

As the medical monopoly Soviet Union-like 'echo chamber' and 'perverse incentive' structure materializes, there is a competitive-selective process that selects for the most negligent or ruthless apes who are more and more likely to dismiss dissent and push the government to suppress competing-critical opinions. A good and early example of this was the banning by Youtube of a [video that in just a few days had reached over 5 million views](https://www.bitchute.com/video/56R2zmYXSfIK/) by Doctors Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi of Bakersfield California where they explained the relative harmlessness of the CV compared to what Fauci-Tedros-CDC-WHO were preaching. In an interview about the matter, Youtube CEO Susan Wojciki, mentioned that they took the video down because "Anything that would go against World Health Organization recommendations would [be a violation of our policy".](https://youtu.be/sPrbGU0Wyh4?t=271). Again! economic ignorance, ignorance of how superior information can only be discovered by competition and thus freedom, always leads to a 'central plan' that eventually necessitates coercion and the suppression and eventual vilification of dissenting views(right-winger, 'science denier'). It is no longer freedom and competition what determines the truth-information, it is the monopoly-competition-immune ideologues at the World Health Organization and national competition-immune national bureaucracies. This is not the result of some malice by Susan, she is simply the particular slightly smarter ape that inevitably rises to her position just like Goebbels inevitably emerged to fill a similar role in Nazi Germany. What can mistakenly seem like a 'conspiracy' by Susan-Fauci-Gates-etc.  IS NOT!, it is "indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design"... So you have polarizing 'echo chambers' and increasingly conflicting groups (a) The central planners who have to increasingly 'conspire' to continue their ideology-plans even if it was never 'conspired' from the beginning, and (b) doubters-critics, many of whom mistakenly label the 'central planners' in general as one massive cabal of "bad guys". The 'central planners' clearly find such insults misguided and nutty, so they easily use that to justify ignoring and persecuting dissenting views and so on intensifying the polarization-persecution-hatreds. 

During the early days of the Bolshevik revolution, many communists were fiercely for principled freedom of speech. Many had experienced severe censorship and jail time under the Tsar for expressing their views. But again, bad-complex ideas eventually show cracks and inevitable dissent and differing(competing) opinions, if they are to persist and require unity for their execution, they must be carried out by force and dissenting views increasingly suppressed. Hayek summarizes[our comments applied to Coromunism]:

>"The creation and enforcement of the common creed [lockdowns-masks-vaccine] and of the belief in the supreme wisdom of the ruler [Fauci-Tedros-Politicians] becomes an indispensable instrument for the success of the planned system. The ruthless use of all potential instruments of propaganda and the suppression of every expression of dissent is not an accidental accompaniment of a centrally directed system — it is an essential part of it.

>Nor can moral coercion be confined to the acceptance of the ethical code underlying the whole plan. It is in the nature of things that many parts of this code, many parts of the scale of values underlying the plan, can never be explicitly stated. They exist only implicitly in the plan. But this means that every part of the plan, in fact, every action of the government or its agencies, becomes sacrosanct and exempt from criticism. [If you don't 'social distance', wear masks, ignore the heroic self-sacrificing experts like Fauci you are an immoral selfish negligent killer]

>It is, however, only the expression of criticism that can be forcibly suppressed. But doubts that are never uttered and hesitation that is never voiced have equally insidious effects, even if they dwell only in the minds of the people. Everything which might induce discontent must therefore be kept from them. The basis for comparison with conditions elsewhere [no-lockdown Sweden, Florida, etc.], the knowledge of possible alternatives to the course taken, information which might suggest failure on the part of the government to live up to its promises or to take advantage of opportunities to improve the lot of the people — all these [must be suppressed."](https://mises.org/library/what-price-planned-economy) (Hayek, 1938)


The vaccines were an obvious calamity to anyone who was not part of, or under the sway of, the 'Priesthood of Scientism. Soon after the vaccines were rolled out, by as early as 12/20/2020 per image below, according to the CDC 1 out of 35 people taking the Covid vaccines were being incapacitated to the point where they were "unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, required care from doctor or health care professional". By 3/25/2022 almost 270 million Americans got at least one dose, that means that almost 8 million Americans were injured to the point where they were "unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, required care from doctor or health care professional". 

<img src="../../images/vsafe.png" alt="Vaccine damage"
	title="Vaccine damage" width="700" height="400" />

There is only one simple statistic needed to show how your average doctor is as willing to go along with harmful mythology as much as the priests during the Spanish Inquisition or the bureucrats in Communist regimes. Per below, in over 3 years of CovidMania, in a population of over 73 million kids under 18 years old, 1,529 of them died having tested positive for covid. This does not even mean that it was the alleged covid that killed them by itself, they just tested positive and thus considered to be a factor in their deaths. That's 510 kids per year or about 7 kids per million. Over this statistically insignificant number which is still based on bullshit shitty PCR tests and other layers of pseudoscience, even assuming that testing and diagnosis was 100% correct, over this nonetheless insignificant number the 'Priesthood of Scientism' and its medical priests are attempting to coerce 69 million kids (73 minus 4 million kids under 6 months) to be injected with bullshit vaccines-talismans.

Regardless of what exactly the CV pathogen is and all the technical-scientific details about it, the initial scare and lockdowns were based on a quickly-revised and later totally discredited "epidemiological model" which grossly overestimated the lethality of the Coronavirus by British Professor Neil Ferguson who had made numerous totally bogus and exaggerated predictions before, like:

1. That up to 50,000 people would likely die from exposure to mad cow disease in beef in the UK, only 177 died.
2. That up to 150 million people could be killed from bird flu. Only 282 died worldwide between 2003 and 2009.
3. That swine flu could led to 65,000 deaths in the UK. Only 457 died.
4. That up to 150,000 people could die from a foot-and-mouth disease scare. There were fewer than 200 deaths.

All of these so-called "diseases" which led to such ultimately over-hyped and totally unnecessary fears and restrictions like "mad cow", "bird flu", "swine flu", "foot-and-mouth" and ultimately the Covid19 disease all seem to involve what we commonly refer to as viruses, which are soo small, that once again even with our best electron microscopes, their alleged functioning and interactions with the complex immune system remain the subject of much research and competing opinions. Again, wherever there is complexity, there is bound to be uncertainty and eventual mythology, and if these mythologies are sustained by competitionless government coercion-regulation the intellectual errors-myths are harder to change. What if our low-level understanding of the biochemistry relating to viruses-vaccines and the immune system was nowhere near as precise as mainstream scientists believe. What if the entire scientific establishment is as misguided as it was just a few decades ago when it went along with lobotomies, worms as the cause of cancer, and ridiculed people like Ignaz Semmelweis and Alfred Wegener? This brings us to the HIV-causes-AIDS and eventual death hypothesis which could be one of these massive errors-myths of modern "science" and its surprising relevance-application to current CovidMania and Government (monopoly) science-Scientism in general. Even if it is NOT a mistake there is still a tremendous amount to be learned by examining this subject.

Before delving deeper into this controversial and dangerous subject we can divide its protagonists into two camps, the mainstream and government (monopoly-force-huge-money) backed thinkers who believe that the HIV virus eventually weakens people's immune systems and they die of some opportunistic disease, and those who disagree with this hypothesis to various degrees, or are highly skeptical at least. There is a pro-standard view that HIV->AIDS->death website https://www.aidstruth.org/ which defends the standard narrative and there are also sites like https://rethinkingaids.com/ which back the doubter's views. Given the immense complexity of the subject and human nature, there are tremendous extremes, from seemingly nutty religious people who will say the whole thing is a massive "conspiracy"-"hoax" inspired by devil-evil-doers, to "scientists" who at various points have peddled or exaggerated ridiculous scaremongering scenarios for financial gain, and honest researchers. And then there are also smaller disagreements even withing their respective camps...


Consider the story of molecular [biologist Dr. Peter Deusberg.](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2006/02/donald-w-miller-jr-md/the-copernicus-of-aids/) Peter was a brilliant researcher who was awarded tenure at UC Berkeley at just 36 years of age and was considered for a Nobel Prize. Some of his early awards are:

1969, Merck Award ("recognizes outstanding contributions to research in biochemistry and molecular biology")
1971, California Scientist of the Year Award
1981, First Annual American Medical Center Oncology Award
1986, Outstanding Investigator Award, National Institutes of Health
1986, elected to National Academy of Sciences

When AIDS became the pandemic that was supposed to wipe out millions in the 1980s Deusberg took an interest in the subject and concluded that the HIV virus was likely to be harmless and thus NOT what was eventually killing these people, and hypothesized that the weakened immune systems of people who would be diagnosed as having AIDS had more to do with damage due primarily to certain heavy drug use, particularly so-called "poppers"(nitrite inhalants) which were very popular among homosexuals, also other factors like intravenous drug use which is known to damage-stress the immune system as well as other potential factors-unknowns. His book ["Inventing the AIDS Virus" (4.7/5 stars with over 100 reviews on Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Inventing-the-AIDS-Virus/dp/B00DBAXVMU/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=peter+duesberg&qid=1607924317&sr=8-1) seemed like a masterpiece to me as further evidenced by the many glowing and well written reviews. Peter would be one of the first big-time scientist to question the evolving mainstream narrative that HIV was the virus that caused AIDS-like symptoms and eventually death. Just like with Covid and the Great Barrington Declaration, many other scientists would also lend their names to various letters-documents of dissent-doubt. For example Charles Thomas Ph.D. was a former Professor of Biochemistry at Harvard and John Hopkins Universities  who organized [*The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis*](https://www.virusmyth.com/aids/group.htm) Another brilliant scientist, Kary B. Mullis, the 1993 Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry and inventor of the polymerase chain reaction(PCR) was also highly critical of the HIV->AIDS->death hypothesis and a defender of Deusberg's criticisms.

Just like Fauci would dismiss the GBD signed by world-renowned infectious disease experts as "ridiculous", "total nonsense" and "very dangerous" without debating them, so would he avoid going to conferences if Deusberg was also to attend.

>"In the year since Mr. Duesberg first advanced his theories in a paper in Cancer Research, leading AIDS investigators have been unanimous in their refusal to rebut him, despite requests from universities and press forums like the “MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.” They have been willing, however, to justify their silence at length. Anthony Fauci, coordinator of AIDS research at the National Institutes of Health, recently explained on National Public Radio, “Critiquing a dubious theory would take time away from more [productive efforts.”"](https://www.functionalps.com/blog/2012/04/07/the-aids-debate-that-isnt/) (Leishman, 1988)

Fauci also mentioned:

>"...many people consider what is in the media to be true by definition. One striking example is Peter Duesberg’s theory that HIV is not the cause of AIDS. I laughed at that for a while, but it led to a lot of public concern that maybe HIV was a hoax. The theory has extraordinary credibility just on the [basis of news coverage."[(Baily, p. 162)](https://books.google.com/books?id=glCNJzN4ZXUC&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=%22One+striking+example+is+Peter+Duesberg+theory+that+HIV+is+not+the+cause+of+AIDS.+I+laughed%22&source=bl&ots=zOeRHP8ETt&sig=ACfU3U2kAkquB-4UDsBomu8vWlCeqwdpnQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjQn7L154f5AhWkM1kFHZcXARcQ6AF6BAgDEAM#v=onepage&q=%22One%20striking%20example%20is%20Peter%20Duesberg%20theory%20that%20HIV%20is%20not%20the%20cause%20of%20AIDS.%20I%20laughed%22&f=false)

Perhaps this last statement helps us understand why Fauci would dismiss Deusberg without necessarily doing so purely out of malice or negligence. Perhaps the following is at play:  1) Deusberg voices his criticisms, 2) then naive thinkers or very religious-types go around saying the whole thing is a "conspiracy" or a "hoax", 3) Fauci learns that it is Deusberg's work which led to the labels of "hoax" and "conspiracy theories" which he clearly knows are not true, 4) so he dismisses Deusberg. Or maybe not, maybe he plays the role of a modern Pope who is not very motivated to discuss theology with Richard Dawkins. Or perhaps some complex combination of numerous other factors. Maybe he is right and Deusberg wrong. Again, a very complex subject which requires freedom and resulting 'competitive knowledge discovery' instead of coercive government monopoly.

Today there is little doubt that many of the people who were supposedly dying of AIDS in the late-early 1980-90s were dying due to the immense toxicity of the early drugs [like AZT](https://www.spin.com/featured/aids-and-the-azt-scandal-spin-1989-feature-sins-of-omission/#:~:text=The%20toxic%20effects%20of%20AZT,to%20be%20taken%20off%20it.). How can a compound discovered in 1964 when we knew way less about the immensely complex biochemical pathways that sustain our order, and was deemed too dangerous and ineffective then, suddenly be given to people now for years and not expect it to be doing immense harm? We quote Celia Farber's article on Spin Magazine ["AIDS and the AZT Scandal: SPIN’s 1989 Feature, ‘Sins of Omission’"](https://www.spin.com/featured/aids-and-the-azt-scandal-spin-1989-feature-sins-of-omission/) ([see a critique of her article by prominent HIV researchers here](https://www.aidstruth.org/documents/ErrorsInFarberArticle.pdf))

>"[AZT]....had actually been developed a quarter of a century earlier as a cancer chemotherapy, but was shelved and forgotten because it was so toxic, very expensive to produce, and totally ineffective against cancer. Powerful, but unspecific, the drug was not selective in its cell destruction...

>"Dr. Harvey Bialy, scientific editor of the journal Biotechnology, is stunned by the low quality of science surrounding AIDS research. When asked if he had seen any evidence of the claims made for AZT, that it “prolongs life” in AIDS patients, Bialy said, “No, I have not seen a published study that is rigorously done, analyzed, and objectively reported.”

>Bialy, who is also a molecular biologist, is horrified by the widespread use of AZT, not just because it is toxic, but because, he insists, the claims its widespread use are based upon are false. “I can’t see how this drug could be doing anything other than making people very sick,” he says....

>"Most ironically, the drug has been found to accelerate the very process it was said to prevent: the loss of T-4 cells.

>Undeniably, AZT kills T-4 cells [white blood cells vital to the immune system],” says Bialy. “No one can argue with that. AZT is a chain-terminating nucleotide, which means that it stops DNA replication. It seeks out any cell that is engaged in DNA replication and kills it. The place where most of this replication is taking place is in the bone marrow. That’s why the most common and severe side effect of the drug is bone marrow toxicity. That is why they [patients] need blood transfusions.”

>AZT has been aggressively and repeatedly marketed as a drug that prolongs survival in AIDS patients because it stops the HIV virus from replicating and spreading to healthy cells. But, says Bialy: “There is no good evidence that HIV actively replicates in a person with AIDS, and if there isn’t much HIV replication to stop, it’s mostly killing healthy cells.”....

>"As a chemotherapeutic drug, explained Duesberg, AZT “kills dividing blood cells and other cells,” and is thus “directly immunosuppressive.”

>“The cell is almost a million-fold bigger target than the virus, so the cell will be much, much more sensitive,” says Duesberg. “Only very few cells, about one in 10,000, are actively making the virus containing DNA, so you must kill incredibly large numbers of cells to inhibit the virus. This kind of treatment could only theoretically help if you have a massive infection, which is not the case with AIDS. Meanwhile, they’re giving this drug that ends up killing millions of lymphocytes [white blood cells]. It’s beyond me how that could possibly be beneficial.”"

Again! Again! The immense complexity of the biochemical order can eventually lead to differences in opinion and an environment where flat out lies, extreme negligence and honest intellectual error can easily arise from all sides. In the passage below we see how Dr. Sandra Lehrman, a scientist working for the AZT manufacturer 'Burroughs Wellcome' which was making a fortune($10,000 per year per patient in 1987 ($22,000 in today's dollars)) with AZT, saw things:

>"When specific questions about the alleged mechanisms of AZT are asked, the answers are long, contradictory, and riddled with unknowns. Every scientific point raised about the drug is eventually answered with the blanket response, “The drug is not perfect, but it’s all we have right now.” About the depletion of T-4 cells and other white cells, Lehrman says, “We don’t know why T-4 cells go up at first, and then go down. That is one of the drug mechanisms that we are trying to understand.”"

In his book ["Poison By Prescription: The AZT Story"](https://www.scribd.com/document/111057800/Poison-by-prescription-The-AZT-story#download) John Lauritsen, who obtained data about the trial which the FDA was forced to release via the Freedom of Information act, writes:


>"The FDA analyst who reviewed the pharmacology data, Harvey I. Chernov, recommended that AZT should not be approved. Chernov documented many serious side effects of AZT, and summarized its effect on the blood as follows: 

>>"Thus, although the dose varied, anemia was noted in all species (including man) in which the drug has been tested."

>"Chernov concluded his review of the pharmacology data by recommending that AZT should not be approved:

>>"In conclusion, the full preclinical toxicological profile if far from complete with 6-month data
available, but not yet submitted, one-year studies to begin shortly, etc. The available data are insufficient to support FDA approval" (Lauritsen)

As the immense toxicity became increasingly apparent, the FDA ("the science") cut the dose in half. Prior to this change, anyone saying that AZT at old dose was doing immense harm was of course what in today's climate would be called a "science denier", someone giving dangerous advice that could cost lives and should perhaps be jailed. Lauritsen again:

>"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced on 17 january 1990 that the recommended dose of AZT, the only federally approved drug for AIDS, would be cut in half. The old dose was 1200 milligrams per day. The new dose will be only half that: 600 milligrams per day after one month at the old dose of 1200 milligrams. The FDA has ordered changes in the labels on AZT (also known as zidovudine or Retrovir) to represent the new recommendation. 

>For some time prior to the FDA's announcement, doctors who treat "AIDS" patients had been experimenting with lower doses, in an effort to avoid the side effects of the drug. At the old dose of 1200 milligrams, about half of all "AIDS" patients had been unable to tolerate AZT's extreme toxicity, which caused severe anemia, as well as muscular pain and atrophy (wasting away) and damage to the kidneys, liver, and nerves. 

>Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said in a statement that the change "means that fewer patients may have to discontinue AZT therapy because of serious side effects."

>The new dose recommendation was based on government press releases from last summer, which allegedly showed that the lower dose was just as effective as the higher, while causing fewer serious side effects." 

Beloved stars like singer Freddie Mercury and tennis legend Arthur Ashe were AZT victims. Basketball star Magic Johnson seems to have saved himself by stopping AZT before it was too late. Engelbrecht-Claus-Bailey-Scoglio write in their SUPERB!!!! book ["Virus Mania"](https://www.amazon.com/Virus-Mania-COVID-19-Hepatitis-Billion-Dollar/dp/B094X3F7D9/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=virus+mania&qid=1622394214&sr=8-1):

>"Mercury was terrified and took his doctor's advice to begin taking AZT. Mercury belonged to
the first generation of patients, who received the full AZT load (1500 mg a day). At the end, he looked like a bone rack, and he died in London on 24 November 1991 at the age of 45."...

>"...Arthur Ashe met his maker at the age of 36, after he had been declared HIV positive in 1988 and his doctor prescribed for him an extremely high AZT dose.
>At some point, Ashe discussed AZT's toxicity. In October 1992, he wrote a column for the Washington Post. "The confusion for AIDS patients like me is that there is a growing school of thought that HIV may not be the sole cause of AIDS, and that standard treatments such as AZT actually make matters worse," Ashe acknowledged, adding, "there may very well be unknown co-factors, but that the medical establishment is too rigid to change the direction of basic research and/or clinical trials." Ashe wanted to stop taking AZT, but he didn't dare: "What will I tell my doctors?" he asked the New York Daily News."

...

>"What Ashe didn't have the heart to do-resist the pressure of prevailing AIDS medicine and decide against AZT intake-apparently saved the life of basketball megastar Earvin "Magic" Johnson.

>At the end of 1991, Magic shocked the world with the news he had tested HIV positive. "It can happen to anybody, even Magic Johnson," said Time magazine on 18 November 1991. A few days later, Time wrote that the basketball player had "put the risk of heterosexual transmission squarely in center court." But what was the basis of this assumption? Nothing at all, for the American magazine-just like the rest of the media world-simply referred to Johnson's mere conjecture that he had "picked up the AIDS virus heterosexually," that is to say through sex with a
woman. 
>Evidence to support this statement is not available. Magic Johnson had tested positive, but at the same time, he was the picture of health-until "AIDS ruier" Anthony Fauci and his personal doctor, the New York AIDS researcher David Ho, insistently advised him to take AZT. Johnson followed their advice. 
>But Magic's health rapidly deteriorated, so much, in fact, that he felt "like vomiting almost every day," according to a 1991 National Enquirer story "Magic Reeling as Worst Nightmare Comes True-He's Getting Sicker." But virus mania was by then so dominant that nobody thought that the extremely toxic medications could have caused Magic's serious health problems....years later, in 1995, he admitted in a personal conversation in Florida that he had only taken AZT for a very short time. The medications were connected with far too severe side effects. And so came the saying, "There is no magic in AZT, and no AZT in 'Magic. "" (Köhnlein)


Interestingly enough Anthony Fauci was also one of the early proponents of AZT and has been the main ideologue diverting the vast resources of the US government towards the HIV->AIDS hypothesis and away from its criticisms.

In the early 80s when scientists where trying to make sense out of why so many of these overwhelmingly drug-using-gay-men where having very weak immune systems and dying, based on early hypotheticals and a paper he appears to not have gotten the opportunity to read in its entirety, Fauci wrote things in a manner that led to hysteria when he wrote:

>“We are witnessing at the present time the evolution of a new disease process of unknown etiology with a mortality of at least 50 percent and possibly as high as 75 percent to 100 percent with a doubling of the number of patients afflicted every six months.”...

>"The finding of AIDS in infants and children who are household contacts of patients with AIDS or persons with risks for AIDS has enormous implications with regard to ultimate transmissibility of this syndrome,”.... “If routine close contact can spread the disease, AIDS takes on an entirely new dimension,” (Shilts, p. 299)

Suddenly a respected official government "expert" was mentioning how we could have a highly infectious and deadly disease on our hands that could potentially quickly wipe out millions. The AIDS hysteria exploded. With the best of intentions many demanded the government immediately increase AIDS-related funding, not doing so and easily pointing to some religious leaders who were themselves spreading AIDS hysteria by saying that AIDS was God's punishment for homosexuality, would make the conservative Reagan administration look like that standard "evil selfish white man who uses Capitalism to exploit and doesn't care"... and the money for AIDS research exploded. A year later Fauci became Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Shilts writes in his book "And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the [AIDS Epidemic"](https://www.amazon.com/Band-Played-Politics-Epidemic-20th-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B000V761ZA/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Shilts+hiv&qid=1609219010&sr=8-1):

>"Fauci quickly cast blame on a hysterical media for taking his comments “out of context.” After all, he had said only that the possibility of household transition might raise all these scientific implications. The lay public did not understand the language of science, he pleaded. Science always dealt with hypotheticals….the chief villain, he would accurately note, was the press office of the American Medical Association" (Shilts, p. 300-301)

Again, to the immense biochemical complexity we add various layers of human nature-ignorance-errors-incentives-etc. An ideological pattern or "algorithm" emerges, the more rightly "concerned" for gays and the suffering of potential AIDS victims people are, and the more "prudent", the more "could potentially"-type scenarios arise, the more incentive (both out of genuine concern and out of potential profit and scientific glory) arises and warps government spending in a way that accelerates both funding and more "hypothetically dangerous" scenarios. Again, this is not the result of some "well orchestrated plot" it is "indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design". 

Robert Redfield, the current Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who has been another main ideologue in CovidMania was a wild exaggerator of the potential transmissibility of HIV. For example, researcher Michael Fumento who has written extensively on HIV-AIDS and has challenged Peter Deusberg to willingly infect himself with HIV if he is so sure that it is as harmless as Deusberg says, writes in his book ["The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS: How a Tragedy Has Been Distorted by the Media and Partisan Politics"](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Heterosexual-AIDS-Distorted-Partisan/dp/0895267292/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+myth+of+heterosexual+aids&qid=1609088156&sr=8-1)

>"Dr. Redfield, amazingly, has declared male-to-female vaginal HIV transmission to be 50 percent *per contact*, in an interview with Ann Guidici Fettnet. He referred to a letter published in *Lancet* in which it was reported that, of 8 Australian women inseminated artificially with sperm, 4 seroconverted. Redfield asserted: "The bottom line for women is that half of them get infected in spouse studies[and] very few viruses are effectively transmitted even 50 percent of the time. It's a very efficient virus" (Fumento)

Redfield willfully neglected to mention or properly take into account that this was due to specifics of artificial insemination which would NOT apply to regular intercourse. Redfield was way off, today's "consensus" is that HIV transmission is about 1 out of 1,000 sexual acts(0.1% not 50%) with an HIV-positive partner. Redfield has also admitted to flat [out making data up used in graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_R._Redfield#The_Fake_Graph)

But the ideological pattern-algorithm easily overcomes all prior wild "hypotheticals" no matter how off they were with the "at the time we didn't know", "we learned", "we are trying to understand"...Remember Gerson Green?, formerly of the Office of Economic Opportunity, discussing the economic crisis of the 1970s when he said: “The change I discern is that none of us knows what to do. In those days, we thought we did. The country has taught the social engineers a lesson.”??? Again, the immense complexity of the biological and socioeconomic orders, coupled with various incentives, etc. easily allows the "experts"-priests to spew any myth-error and the slightly smarter apes just go along with it because the faith in the omnipotence of government and its experts-planners is our sort of religion.

Just like Covid is being blamed as the cause of death for people who are very old and with multiple comorbidities and likely to soon die anyway, so was a positive HIV test used to heighten AIDS hysteria and possibly kill thousands via AZT poisoning. Nobel Laureate Mullis writes in his biography:

>"The CDC has defined AIDS as one of more than thirty diseases accompanied by a positive result on a test that detects antibodies to HIV. But those same diseases are not defined as AIDS cases when the antibodies are not detected. If an HIV-positive woman develops uterine cancer, for example, she is considered to have AIDS. If she is not HIV-positive, she simply has uterine cancer. An HIV-positive man with tuberculosis has AIDS; if he tests negative he simply has tuberculosis. If he lives in Kenya or Colombia, where the test for HIV antibodies is too expensive, he is simply presumed to have the antibodies and therefore AIDS, and therefore he can be treated in the World Health Organization’s clinic. It’s the only medical help available in some places. And it’s free, because the countries that support the WHO are worried about AIDS. From the point of view of spreading medical facilities into areas where poor people live, AIDS has been a boon. We don’t poison them with AZT like we do our own people because it’s too expensive. We supply dressings for the machete cut on their left knee and call it AIDS...

>In 1634 Galileo was sentenced to house arrest for the last eight years of his life for writing that the Earth is not the center of the universe but rather moves around the sun. Because he insisted that scientific statements should not be a matter of religious faith, he was accused of heresy. Years from now, people looking back at us will find our acceptance of the HIV theory of AIDS as silly as we find the leaders who excommunicated Galileo. Science as it is practiced today in the world is largely not science at all. What people call science is probably very similar to what was called science in 1634. Galileo was told to recant his beliefs or be excommunicated. People who refuse to accept the commandments of the AIDS establishment are basically told the same thing. “If you don’t accept what we say, you’re out.”

>It has been disappointing that so many scientists have absolutely refused to examine the available evidence in a neutral, dispassionate way. Several respected scientific journals have refused to print a statement issued by the Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis simply requesting “a thorough reappraisal of the existing evidence for and against this hypothesis.”

>I spoke publicly about this issue for the first time at a meeting of the American Association for Clinical Chemists in San Diego. I knew I would be among friends there. It was a small part of a much longer speech—at most I spoke for fifteen minutes about AIDS. I told the audience how my inability to find a simple reference had sparked my curiosity.

>The more I learned, the more outspoken I became. As a responsible scientist convinced that people were being killed by useless drugs, I could not remain silent.

>The responses I received from my colleagues ranged from moderate acceptance to outright venom. When I was invited to speak about PCR at the European Federation of Clinical Investigation in Toledo, Spain, I told them that I would like to speak about HIV and AIDS instead. I don’t think they understood exactly what they were getting into when they agreed. Halfway through my speech, the president of the society cut me off. He suggested I answer some questions from the audience. I thought it was incredibly rude and totally out of line that he cut me off, but what the hell, I would answer questions. He opened the floor to questions and then decided that he would ask the first one. Did I understand that I was being irresponsible? That people who listened to me might stop using condoms? I replied that fairly reliable statistics from the CDC showed that in the United States, at least, the number of reported cases of every known venereal disease was increasing, meaning people were not using condoms, while using the initial definition of AIDS, the number of reported cases of AIDS was decreasing. So, no. I didn’t understand that I was being irresponsible. He decided that that was enough questions and ended [the meeting abruptly."](https://www.amazon.com/Dancing-Naked-Mind-Field-Mullis/dp/0679774009/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=kary+mullis&qid=1605906208&sr=8-1) (Mullis, p. 179-181)


Regarding Anthony Fauci, Mullis mentioned:

"...guys like Fauci get up there and start talking, you know he doesn't know anything about anything and I'd say that to his face. Nothing...He should not be in a position like he is in. Most of those guys up there on the top are just total administrative people who don't know anything about what is going on at the bottom....They make up their own rules as they go, they change them when they want to... You can't expect the sheep to really respect the best and the brightest. They don't know the difference really...The vast majority of them do not posses the ability to judge who is and who isn't a really good scientist... That's the main problem actually with science I'd say in this century because the science is being judged by people, funding is being done by people who don't understand it. Okay, who do we trust, Fauci? Fauci doesn't know enough to you know...If Fauci wants to get on television with somebody who knows a little bit about this stuff and debate them he could easily do it because he's been asked. I mean, I've had a lot of people, president of the university of South Carolina ask Fauci if he'd come there and debate me on the stage in front of the [student body...."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtgUGxxzB_c)


Once again Fauci's now double-refusal to meaningfully engage top scientists who disagree with his views should not be seen as some purely-malicious neglect, again, perhaps most of the times when Fauci hears about an HIV->AIDS doubter-critic, or someone who is highly critical of his Covid recommendations, he usually hears from some overtly-religious person who thinks Fauci is part of some secret cabal who just wants to make money while he does not see himself that way. Or civilization might have another Lysenko-like individual. The Pope must be aware of many critics with various arguments, yet he has his reasons-ideology to continue-justify his views without, once again, be shown to be 100% malicious. Or perhaps Deusberg and Mullis and the mainstream-doubters were-are wrong, and those whose minds were swayed by their arguments have been misled or have fraudulent motives, perhaps in selling quack cures-etc. From the perspective of the HIV->AIDS->Death doubters it is the mainstream whose cognitive dissonance and financial incentives has evolved an 'echo chamber' and 'incentive structure' that has misled them, yet similarly, some Deusberg critics mention that he is a sort of contrarian with an immense ego who has simply doggedly refused to properly admit to error.

In 2019 the US gov. spent $34.8 billion dollars on HIV-related causes, that is more wealth than the entire countries of Iceland (GDP 24.5 billion) and Chad (9.87) produce in a year COMBINED. Since Deusberg and the doubters felt like HIV was not the cause of AIDS-death, it is not surprising to them that after nearly 40 years of HIV "research" no vaccine has or will ever be found. 

We are done bringing up this subject which just like the fields of nutrition and economics, focuses our attention on 'complex phenomena' where the mainstream is likely to be wrong, and as the slightly smarter apes always fall for, coercive-monopoly governments give rise to misguided-perverse and ultimately mythological structures which oppress potential heroic Galileos (Noakes, Deusberg, etc)-dissent and once again threaten civilization.

Hardly any of what has been mentioned above (from who is right or wrong, who has been malicious or negligent or well-intentioned) should matter much to a citizenry that has a basic understanding of economics. How do we "discover" the truth when the subject matter can be so complex and we are dealing with dangerous slightly smarter apes who have spent most of their evolution fervently believing numerous myths, lying, raping, easily segregating themselves into us vs. them and slaughtering each other? What is really needed is a basic understanding of how competition, unhampered by government(coercive-competitionless) influence, which requires freedom, is the key to discover information. Civilization does NOT need the right answers or "experts", we just need competitive knowledge discovery, we need freedom! The moment the government coerces someone, it is not only threatening to beat-imprison-kill people and preventing them from acting on other information they deem best, the government is attempting to implement monopoly-competitionless plans that are inferior, especially when it comes to medicine and things like *mandatory* anything-vaccinations.
