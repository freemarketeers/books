#### The Mythology of War

From 1337 to 1453 the "Hundred Years' War" between England and France took place. Do you know who the good guys and evildoers were in this conflict? Was this war and its destruction of life and property necessary? Of course not. Since the truth is that wars are the worst thing man can do and that peaceful cooperation in the global free-market is in everyone's best interest, all wars are essentially based on mythology, on "a widely held but false belief or idea". Our current large national militaries are an obvious sign of how economically ignorant the masses and "intellectual leaders" are. When people join a military they are surrendering their freedom to do what some clueless tribal apes-politicians like Biden or Trump feel we need to do, and also giving up on the ability to use reason and a thoughtful, compassionate, and nuanced understanding of the world to solve potential misunderstandings. It is an understandable fallacy made by slightly smarter apes that have zero clue how the socioeconomic order works and much less has evolved. Let us learn from history and see how from the immense complexity arising out of the interaction of human nature, economic ignorance, and other factors, myths leading to war arise and their numerous continuing repercussions.
