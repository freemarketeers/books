In this talk I want to highlight the emergence of the economic fallacies that underpin mankind's racial problems, especially as they relate to the US. In order to keep this presentation somewhat self-contained, I'll begin with a 3 minute overview to how the economy works and has evolved. 

From the tradition of private property emerges the 'freedom to trade' which inadvertently turns mankind into a super-computer where private sector companies are motivated to innovate and copy each other's innovations as they inadvertently compete for customers thus inadvertently spreading superior information and subsequent social order. For example, maybe it was Honda in Japan that came up with power doorlocks and windows and people’s freedom all over the world to purchase the better Hondas motivated competitors like BMW, and Ford to also copy and thus spread the better ideas. Morals are also ways of acting, they are information which is also spread by competition. It is hard-working, courteous, tolerant people who thanks to economic competition motivate everyone else to be likewise. This wonderful mechanism of 'competitive knowledge discovery' only works well in the private sector where private companies are dependent on the wealth freely traded by customers.

The role of governments or coercion should be minimized because governmental or ‘public sector’ bureaucracies, being COERCIVE MONOPOLIES which get their life-order-sustaining wealth through taxes or compulsion are immune to the competitive-information-spreading incentives and pressures which motivate private sector entities to keep up with the competition in terms of information and hustle. Central-government plans can’t work if people are free to not go along with them so they inevitably require compulsion-tyranny. The “classic” image below helps explain the difference between competitive-private-free orders(South Korea) and monopolistic-government-coerced orders (North Korea)

This wonderful mechanism of 'competitive knowledge discovery' coupled with things like money, finance, banking, interest rates, and the legal structures that sustain it, taken together are what economists refer to as 'The Market process'. And just like language is a vital mechanism that was created by homo sapiens but not designed by him, so is 'the market process'. The 'market process' is to the social order what the respiratory, digestive, nervous and other "systems" are to the biological order, it is something that is the result of the actions of people or cells, but not designed by them. Generally speaking mankind and its leading "experts" are as ignorant of the workings of the social order and its evolution as the cells in your body are regarding the workings of the complex order they are a part of. 

Knowing that 'private property' is the vital concept that leads to a chain-reaction of incentives which creates the modern social order, we can easily look back at history and see that those cultures whose customs inadvertently became more peaceful and thus less violent, extended peace-friendship-trade to more people, in other words, those who tended to respect 'private property' and thus individual freedom more and more, would inadvertently get the superior 'competitive knowledge discovery' that emerges from freedom and become more advanced-powerful, and as they grew, they would inadvertently spread the very customs and evolving economic system (Capitalism) that allowed them to reach such relative heights. The true sort of 'designer' of the market process or Capitalism was NOT man's reason, it was our old friend 'natural selection' acting on groups and cultures, inadvertently selecting those customs-ideologies-concepts that led to more freedom as if they were genes.


This is vital for understanding why mankind constantly falls for the erroneous idea or myth that large coercive-monopolistic-competition-immune governments are needed to manage or improve society.

Notice how all man-made calamities, from religious slaughters, to world wars, to political chaos, are always the result of homo sapeins coercing each other via government. No matter how big private entities like Amazon, Microsoft or Google get, their respective employees never think about attacking each other. We have simply not evolved to understand the economic forces that create civilization, the vital need for freedom and privatization, and the immense harm that too much government can do. Supposedly the Dodo bird quickly went extinct because it had not evolved to recognize humans as potential dangers, Homo sapiens similarly just lines up for 'central planning' and government coordinated self-mutilation over and over and over and over.

Let us now focus on how economic ignorance led to and exacerbates racial problems.

Given mankind's current ignorance of how the socioeconomic order works and has evolved(Menger-Mises-Hayek-etc. are still not mainstream), which is something that has potentially little to do with race, it is quite understandable how various race-related fallacies which equate civilization with 'white people', like British-European Imperialism and Nazism, dominated much of the last few centuries. The understandable mindset of Europeans which justified slavery went as follows. We quote the superb book 'Competition and Coercion: Blacks in the American Economy' by Prof. Robert Higgs:

“Black slavery, so the story went, was a “positive good” because the blacks were inherently inferior. The whites stood in the position of “natural” superiors. But they recognized an obligation to the blacks like that of a parent toward a child, an obligation to protect and care for the simple needs of a simple people. They recognized, too, that the black could offer useful services in return, generally the performance of arduous field labor in the production of the Southern staple crops. With whites and blacks occupying their preordained social and economic spheres, society would not only be prosperous but happy, for everyone would recognize and fill his proper “place”. Finding biblical, even “scientific,” support for these beliefs was not difficult for people committed to them in any event.

After the Civil War, DeBow’s Review, a leading organ of Southern opinion, opened its pages to a proslavery theorist, George Fitzhugh, who expounded the philosophy of race relations most widely accepted in the South:

“We should treat them [the blacks] as mere grown-up children, entitled like children, or apprentices, to the protection of guardians or masters, and bound to obey those put above them, in place of parents, just as children are so bound. Little legal regulation is needed to induce white men to work. But a great deal of severe legislation will be required to compel negroes to labor as much as they should, in order not to become a charge upon the whites. We must have a black code… Mere law cannot sufficiently govern negroes… They need masters of some sort, as well to protect as to govern them. And masters they will have, or soon perish and disappear from the face of the earth.

...Nature never intended, and never will permit the races to live together, except as masters and slaves, so that the superior race, commanding the labor of the inferior race, shall at the same time be compelled to provide for, and take care of that race. We do not mean by slavery such as that which has been recently abolished, but some form of subordination of the inferior race that shall compel them to labor, whilst it protects their rights and provides for their wants."
 
Evidently white Southerners intended to preserve the privileged position of their race regardless of the emancipation.” (Higgs, 1980, p. 7)

And of course, the "experts" and "the science" of the day had all sorts of explanations as to why blacks were inferior and needed whites to make them more productive and civilized. For example in 1851, American physician Samuel A. Cartwright hypothesized that a mental illness he called *Drapetomania* caused slaves to flee captivity. Believe it or not, sometimes the established "science" and Faucis can be wrong.

Now, why did Europeans think and act in such a manner? Does this really need further analysis? This is just the way people understandably thought back in the day. 

Next I want to briefly quote Thomas Sowell's masterpiece 'Ethnic America: A History'. Sowell writes:

“In narrowly material terms, slaves in the United States were usually amply fed with low-quality food, and their housing – although primitive by today’s standards—was comparable to(or better than) that of contemporary European peasants or workers. The average life-span of nineteenth-century American slaves was slightly below that of whites in the United States, but the same as the lifespan in Holland and France and greater than that in Italy or Austria. Slaves in the United States lived an average of thirty-six years; peasants in Ireland, nineteen years. To the slave owner, slaves were an investment, and one to be safeguarded. For example, slave owners typically hired white workers –typically Irish immigrants—to do work considered too dangerous for slaves.” 

So as bad as slaves have it in the US, the relatively freer economy compared to Europe at the time managed to increase their living standards in some ways compared to others. 


African Americans during slavery obviously wanted freedom from bondage and the freedom to compete and keep the fruits of their labor. As they gained such freedom their socioeconomic progress as measured by literacy, marriage rates, income, etc. was quickly catching up to those of whites and was higher in numerous black neighborhoods in Chicago, Atlanta, and many other cities. While under slavery, not only was there the obvious torture-exhaustion associated with it, there was also a system that prevented the proper existence or function of the family, and also contributed to the creation of a character which was in some ways dependent on slavery itself and ill-suited to freedom, self-reliance and competition in the market-place. For example, Sowell writes:

“With many generations of discouragement of initiative and with little incentive to work any more than necessary to escape punishment, slaves developed foot-dragging, work-evading patterns that were to remain as a cultural legacy long after slavery itself disappeared. Duplicity and theft were also pervasive patterns among antebellum slaves, and these too remained long after slavery ended.” 

“As workers, blacks had acquired little sense of personal responsibility under slavery. Lack of initiative, evasion of work, half-done work, unpredictable absenteeism, and abuse of tools and equipment were pervasive under slavery, and these patterns did not suddenly disappear with emancipation.” 

…In the decades immediately after emancipation, when blacks first became responsible for their own health, death rates among Negroes rose from what they had been under slavery. But as later generations of blacks became more experienced and acculturated, their death rates declined absolutely, and the large gap between black and white death rates also narrowed. 

…“The masses of uncultured, ill-educated, rural southern Negroes who flooded into the northern cities were bitterly resented by blacks and whites alike. The Negro middle class and the northern Negro press denounced them as crude, vulgar, unwashed, rowdy, and criminal and as a menace to the standing of the whole race in the eyes of the larger white community.” 

As already mentioned, freedom and competition is what has evolved our morals-ethics-culture to be hard-working, tolerant and treat everyone with respect and overcame the aforementioned problems created by slavery. Unfortunately blacks didn't just get increasing freedom, they also got constant 'social engineering'-Socialism from well-intentioned whites which often times did more harm than good. Frederick Douglass' advice below was just as important then as it is today (perhaps even more so today):

“Everybody has asked the question. . .“What shall we do with the Negro?” I have had but one answer from the beginning. Do nothing with us! Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us. Do nothing with us! If the apples will not remain on the tree of their own strength, if they are wormeaten at the core, if they are early ripe and disposed to fall, let them fall! I am not for tying or fastening them on the tree in any way, except by nature's plan, and if they will not stay there, let them fall. And if the Negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall also. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his own legs! Let him alone!”


Frederick Douglass also said a few words that carry more wisdom than anything coming out of the mouths of all American psychiatrists combined: *“Men are so constituted that they derive their conviction of their own possibilities largely from the estimate formed of them by others.”*  During slavery, long after, and probably still to this very day, some black people must have felt that they in fact were inferior to whites. This was just inevitable and understandable given that all the technology, the ability to read and write and just about everything that was much more advanced compared to what blacks had achieved was associated with white people. This of course also plays a similar role with many white people believing that they are superior. Again, these ideas are ultimately rooted in economic ignorance. 


In many ways racist fallacies and thorny relations between blacks and whites in the US, inadvertently played a significant role in saving civilization from Socialist mythology. To a significant degree, the desire to not share wealth with blacks was a significant factor in America’s rejection of Socialist mythology. Had the US had a more homogeneous all-white population, the appeal to share the wealth via socialism would have been stronger and likely have succeeded in taking the US towards Soviet Union-like Communism during the 1920s-1940s. This also helps us understand how as America and the whole world fell in love with great musicians like The Platters, The Supremes, The Temptations, Dionne Warwick, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and countless others... as mostly white people filled stadiums cheering on mostly black athletes, in other words, as we became less racist and sypathised with black's ill-treatment and relative lack of prosperity, we understandably saw wealth redistribution and various socialist schemes as a way to help, inadvertently destroying the very freedom and emerging and increasing socioeconomic harmony that had been occurring, leading to where we are today.  


If you are going to have a civil war or unrest you need some simplistic ideas which can segregate and polarize the economically ignorant public. To one economically ignorant group of fellow homo sapiens (the political "Left"-"Democrats"-"Liberals"), the political "Right"-"Republicans"-"Conservatives" is just the "racist white man who uses capitalism to exploit and maintain the status quo for his benefit and Donald Trump and all the other white 'conservative' leaders are the perfect embodiment of this fact". That's pretty much it. It is so-called "identity politics", where the "racist white man" and his supposedly antiquated values(religion) oppresses or discriminates against various groups or "identities"(women-minorities-gays) and overturning such supposed political or economic oppression is what is needed to fix the world's problems by sharing more wealth and funding social programs (competition-less government monopolies) that treat everyone fairly or equitably. The Bolshevik-like level of ignorance and anti-white-male-hate that now dominates the Biden administration was nicely summarized by popular congresswoman from New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, when she mentioned in 1/14/2021:

"The Republican Party...They don't give a damn about the law. They don't give a damn about order. They don't give a damn about safety. They give a damn about white supremacy. They care about preserving the social order and the mythology of whiteness....They lust for power more than they care about democracy"


AOC's fallacies or somewhat understandable. The fact that many whites understandably make the erroneous assumption that their blood-race-religion was a very significant factor in the recent emergence of civilization only helps add fuel to the Left-Right polarization and hatreds. 

Many whites or liberals, with the best of intentions, might be ashamed of the imperialist past of their ancestors or of the racism of their parents-uncles-friends-etc. or their own "shameful" preference for perhaps blue-eyed blondes and erroneously believe that such a past-racism-preference is a significant factor in the relative underachievement or problems of other groups-minorities. A well intentioned economically ignorant person can easily find some "racist CEO" who discriminates based on race and "voilà! this racism is the root of the problems!". This sort of collective sense of guilt is what allows Black Lives Matter rioters to destroy cities virtually unopposed. So we can see how economic ignorance inevitably leads both blacks and whites to increasingly see whatever racism might exist as an increasingly significant problem to fix, via massive government-monopoly-coercion of course as can be seen by today's Democratic party's prominent focus on 'racial justice'. Again, Both groups are wrong. Although it is certainly true that there must be differences in mental ability just like there are differences in physical ones, whatever minute differences can exist are largely irrelevant. It should be easy to see that the explosion in relative human prosperity and technology mankind has stumbled upon during the last 200 years has little to do with biological differences and much more to do with the expansion of the global 'division of labor and information'-free-trade-competition-Capitalism, etc. If a human being can grow up and learn something as complex as a language, which can take even the brightest of people years to master, everyone has more than enough intelligence to understand the basics of how freedom-privatization-free-(trade-movement) are the keys to rapid socioeconomic progress. Clever economic education and marketing is obviously the key.

The overwhelming factor in the relative underachievement of "minorities" compared to "whites", especially African Americans, is simply due to the fact that blacks find themselves (due to obvious historical factors like slavery) in an environment where the economic fallacies which lead to central planning-Socialism (take from others to redistribute equally-fairly via huge monopolistic gov. bureaucracies) are even more convincing-viral. If white people and pretty much everyone hates the rich and Capitalism and wants to see redistribution of wealth via a government monopoly of "experts" as the solution to every problem, it just makes perfect sense that such sentiment would be much stronger with blacks. 




For example, perhaps America's most famous black leader, Martin Luther King, like most other prominent black political leaders and intellectuals, had little understanding of economics, and for reasons already hinted at, his socioeconomic views leaned more towards Socialism. One of today’s leading mainstream African American intellectuals, Michael Eric Dyson writes:

>“King also contended, in 1967, that “the roots [of economic injustice] are in the system rather than in men or faulty operations.” In a remarkable statement in a speech he gave to his staff in 1966, King laid out the ideological basis for his deepened assault on poverty, economic injustice, and class inequality:

>>We are now making demands that will cost the nation something. You can’t talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars. You can’t talk about ending slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums. You’re really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with the captains of industry….Now this means that we are treading in difficult waters, because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong… with capitalism….There must be a better distribution of wealth and maybe America must move toward a Democratic Socialism

>This statement is remarkable since King rarely allowed his positive response to democratic socialism to be recorded. His usual practice, according to one of his aides, was to demand that they “turn off the tape recorder” while he expounded on the virtues of “what he called democratic socialism, and he said, ‘I can’t say this publicly, and if you say I said it I’m not gonna admit to it.’ ” King “didn’t believe that capitalism as it was constructed could meet the needs of poor people” ” 


So, understandably MLK had to keep his Socialist socioeconomic views under wraps but it was hard to conceal the fact that he was often surrounded by communists. Another famous American black leader, Malcolm X, sent a letter to President Truman letting him know that “I have always been a communist”. Perhaps the most famous international black leader, South Africa’s Nelson Mandela who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 is also a Socialist ideologue. In a statement at the beginning of the trial that would send him to jail for 27 years he said:

“We all accept the need for some form of socialism to enable our people to catch up with the advanced countries of this world and to overcome their legacy of extreme poverty...I should tie myself to no particular system of society other than of socialism.” 


The black lives matter organization which has been taken to almost religious-like reverence by so
many well-meaning white people is also understandably an economically ignorant communist organization. Black lives matter founder Patrisse Cullors mentioned that "we're trained Marxists"

These black leaders-intellectuals should not be blamed for the fact that they have inadvertently pushed America in the wrong socioeconomic direction, have helped keep Africa devastatingly poor, and via the ideologically Marxist-Communist Black Lives Matter organization are taking America towards a racial civil war. We want to understand the complex environmental factors that lead to the economic fallacies which then manifest themselves in the more obvious and trivial "identities" of socialists-communists-etc., and place the "blame" on such fallacies instead of blaming the current "identities" of people which can easily change with the proper understanding of economics.

We must always be aware of how difficult it can be to overcome economic fallacies and understand freedom. For example, the great free-market black intellectual-economist Prof. Thomas Sowell still considered himself a Marxist even after getting a Masters degree from Columbia University. Sowell writes in his autobiography:

"The more other government programs I looked into, over the years, the harder I found it to believe that they were a net benefit to society. I had remained a Marxist, despite being at the University of Chicago, but now my experience in Washington began a process of changing my mind completely as to how to deal with social problems. Fortunately, it was a gradual process, so that I was spared the traumatic conversions which some other Marxists have suffered."

As Hayek writes:

“If socialists understood economics they wouldn't be socialists.”


Given the deteriorating racial and economic situation brought about by economic ignorance, the public is looking for answers, unfortunately they are understandably drawn to the same simplistic fallacies which again we can summarize as "Capitalism is the racist white man's tool to enrich himself at the expense of women and minorities". These are the fallacies which underpin all the 'Critical Race Theory' nonsense. For example, books like Angela DiAngelo's "White Fragility" are spreading the usual simplistic "identity"-based and anti-capitalist and thus anti-freedom and pro-coercion fallacies. For example, she writes:

>"...the US economy was based on the abduction and enslavement of African people, the displacement and genocide of indigenous people, and the annexation of Mexican lands"(p. 15-16)

Wrong. Those things certainly occurred, but they were NOT the "base" or most important factors leading to the rising standard of living Americans, and the entire planet, would enjoy as US-made discoveries and innovations spread globally. The US economy was "based" on Capitalism(albeit a very imperfect one of curse), on a relatively strong respect for private property and the emergent 'competitive knowledge discovery' and superior social order it leads to, as well as the emerging "identity" of homo sapiens that best reflects the TRUTH, that regarding the things that really matter all human beings are equal homo sapiens regardless of the cultural and tribalistic baggage we have inherited from by-gone centuries. 

Unfortunately DiAngelo, lacking the proper understanding of how the economy works and has evolved, lacks the necessary framework to properly learn from history. As Mises tells us:

"History speaks only to those people who know how to interpret it on the ground of correct theories."


DiAngelo and the well-intentioned people who always fall for some coercive-monopoly central plan have transformed blacks from rapidly-progressing free-market competitors and innovators to being largely dependent on unproductive-damaging government jobs, thus their wealth, is increasingly that which is coerced from others. 

Patrick J. Buchanan summarizes in an article titled “Obama's Race-Based Spoils System”. He writes:

“Though only 12 percent to 13 percent of the U.S. population, blacks hold 18 percent of all federal jobs. African-Americans are 25 percent of the employees at Treasury and Veterans Affairs, 31 percent of State Department employees, 37 percent of the Department of Education, 38 percent of Housing and Urban Development. They are 42 percent of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 55 percent of the Government Printing Office, 82 percent of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency.

According to The Washington Post, blacks hold 44 percent of the jobs at Fannie Mae and 50 percent of the jobs at Freddie Mac.” 

End of Buchanan quote


DiAngelo's book and views are the nearly inevitable result of the economic ignorance of your average mainstream intellectual.

The economic ignorance leads to personalities which repeat themselves. Bill Gates is essentially a new Albert Einstein, a smart person who achieved a lot in a particular field, but whose economic ignorance is a recipe for coercive central planning and thus the destruction of civilization. The profit motive motivates us to constantly align and plan our actions in a manner where we produce more than we consume thus increasing the economic pie, and competition is what motivates the creation and spread of superior information and order. Einstein, for all his "genius" did not understand this. In an article titled 'Why Socialism?' written in 1949, Einstein writes:

"Technological progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden of work for all. The profit motive, in conjunction with competition among capitalists, is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions. Unlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor…I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy... In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion"


I've read some of Gate's books and many of his blog posts, to my knowledge Gates has NEVER mentioned Ludwig von Mises or F.A. Hayek so he simply does not really understand how the social order really works and thus inevitably, with the best of intentions-negligence-arrogance or whatever the combination of factors might be, he becomes a coercive 'Central Planner'-Totalitarian-Socialist (in this regard). Mises easily predicted the personalities of men like Gates, Hariri, and World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab, and their inevitable totalitarian aims:

"The outstanding fact about the contemporary ideological situation is that the most popular political doctrines aim at totalitarianism, the thorough abolition of the individual's freedom to choose and to act. No less remarkable is the fact that the most bigoted advocates of such a system of conformity call themselves scientists, logicians, and philosophers."
