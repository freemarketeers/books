Hello everyone,

Thank you so much for comming. Our event is, well, our event, and since it is our event we have, not one, but two themes to our event. One is the following: 'Wherever there is complexity there is mythology'.

Imagine you had a time machine and went back in time about 300 years to Salem, Massachusetts during the famed Salem witch trials where 19 women were hanged for witchcraft, and told people that the world could function much better if there was no slavery, that women should have the same rights and freedoms as men, that homosexuality should not be criminalized, and that six million years ago perhaps we had a common ancestor with chimpanzees (we’ll assume they know what chimps are). People would see you as some devilish monstrosity spreading heretical ideas and quickly “conspire” to kill you. Would this mean that the people of the time were somehow dumb or malicious? Or members of some “vast conspiracy” of “bad guys” or “special interests” intent on taking away your freedoms? Of course not. The people would be fellow homo sapiens acting based on the prevailing myths and incentive structures of the times. If by our modern standards pretty much everything about how people saw the world 300 years ago could be understood as myths, in other words, as “widely held but false beliefs or ideas”, why should we not be open to the idea that we too are likewise immersed in mythology?

There is no mythology in things like simple mathematics or how to cook pasta, but when things are complex like where did man come from, history, the economy, biology, astronomy, etc. it is understandably easy for many people with the best on intentions to have "widely held but false beliefs or ideas” , again myths.

Since myths are ideas, how do we discover the best ideas, determine their validity, usefulness and spread them? How do we discover the best information with which to guide our actions and order mankind?

Among numerous great free-market economists of the so-called ‘Austrian School’ ,1974 Nobel Laureate F.A. Hayek(Mick Jagger’s favorite economist), in some of his seminal writings like ‘The Use of Knowledge in Society’ and the aptly titled ‘Competition as a discovery procedure’ helped us realize that the economic competition which emerges from people’s freedom to choose among competing alternatives or ideas is how we motivate the discovery and spread of superior information and subsequent order throughout society. This process of ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ inadvertently turns mankind into a global supercomputer as entrepreneurs via the companies they create are motivated to innovate and have to copy and thus spread each other’s innovations due to billions of minds freely trading their life-sustaining wealth for what they calculate to be best.


Coercion, whether it is by the patriarchy, slave-master, Church, and ultimately government, is not only a burden to those being coerced, but also destroys this wonderful mechanism of ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ that has discovered and spread the superior information which replaced erroneous mythology. This helps us understand how as the coercive and thus competition-immune-monopolistic decision-making power of the Catholic Church was reduced and individual freedom increased in Europe so did emerging ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ and resulting technological advancements thus taking Western civilization to prominence, but as the social order got mind-bogglingly complex in the late 1800s and Socialist-competition-immune-Central-Planning mythology arose, freedom and emerging ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ was destroyed leading to immense suffering and technological stagnation in Communist countries like the former Soviet Union and pre-Capitalist China.


The complexity of the biochemical order also leads to mythology in medicine. A simple look at the history of medical treatments easily shows how most medical treatments throughout history preached by the “experts” of the time have been based on myths that did far more harm than good with the recent CovidMania as a perfect example. History too is a complex field and is also understandably plagued with mythology. I'm sure many have heard the phrase 'In war, truth is first casualty', this may be true, but it is ultimately a "myth", the idea that somehow millions must slaughter millions for whatever reason, that helps create and sustain the wars. Most countries have myths about how their prior presidents and ‘great leaders’ were always righteous while everyone they fought were the ‘bad guys’ or ‘evildoers’. “Our troops fight for freedom and justice while our enemies commit atrocities” is a very popular myth that re-emerges in various wars-etc. 

All wars must be based on myths which deviate from the truth that all human beings are fellow homo sapiens who can maximize prosperity by peaceful cooperation in the global free-market. For example, in the USA we live under the myth that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor because they were some sinister brutal conquerors. As president Truman mentions in a letter to Samuel McCrea Cavert, General Secretary of The Churches of Christ in America referring to the Japanese, “The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them. When you have to deal with a beast you have to treat him as a beast. It is most regrettable but nevertheless true.”  This is of course a myth sadly shared by millions of Americans at the time. Similarly in our current times Putin and the Russians are mistakenly seen as some imperialistic brutal conquerors, and although I find Putin to be a relatively clueless European bureucrat who made a monuental error with his invasion of Ukraine, American politicians constant vilification and warmongering is also based on mythology, the very same sets of myths that led to World War One and World War Two and must be quickly overcome to prevent what will surely be The Final World War. 

We now mention the second theme of our event. 'Austrian Economics or Bust'. 

Most people hope that some great intellectual comes along and provides mankind with a great understanding of the world that can get us on a path to peace and prosperity. Plenty of intellectuals are constantly looking for fame and glory by providing such an understanding.

For example, arguably one of today's "leading intellectuals" is Yuval Noah Harari the author of the wildly popular 'Sapiens:  A Brief History of Humankind'. See here, over 65,000 mostly glowing reviews. Recommended by today's leading personalities like Obama, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. Over seven years after its initial  publication in 2015, it is still at the top of numerous amazon.com categories. There is a section titled 'The Capitalist Hell' where he writes:

"Capitalism has killed millions out of cold indifference coupled with greed."

Mr. Harari is deeply mistaken. He and his book are popular not because they are great but because they reinforce and appeal to the leading fallacies of our day. Surely Pope Urban II's views as he launched the Crusades were popular, and so was Karl Marx's Communist manifesto which is sadly the #2 best-seller in the 'Political Philosophy' category. 

As we and like-minded friends hope to show, what is more likely to be the case is that the great intellectuals we hope explain the world and get mankind on a path to prosperity lie in the past and are commonly referred to as 'The Austrian School of Economics', but their ideas are just still ahead of our time.
Obama, Gates, Zuckerberg,  Hariri and today's 'leading intellectuals', via their global coercive central plans, are once again, inadvertently, and often times with the best of intentions, destroying civilization. 

As Ludwig von Mises wrote over 100 years ago:

"The intellectual leaders of the peoples have produced and propagated the fallacies which are on the point of destroying liberty and Western civilization. The intellectuals alone are responsible for the mass slaughters which are the characteristic mark of our century. They alone can reverse the trend and pave the way for a resurrection of freedom."

Mises also tells us:

"The flowering of human society depends on two factors: the intellectual power of outstanding men to conceive sound social and economic theories..."

This part has already been done by the so-called 'Austrians'. Mises continues:

"and the ability of these or other men to make these ideologies palatable to the majority."

It is this latter part which myself and like-minded friends here and all over the world believe we must focus on.

Hayek writes that “If socialists understood economics they wouldn't be socialists.” So all the socialist-created tyranny of the 20th century which still persists in my native cuba could have been avoided. To a significant degree all physical threats and acts of coercion are ultimately rooted in economic ignorance and should be understood as such. We of course also have to keep an eye on how malicious and extremely negligent people are a significant source of our problems.


Our event is losely divided into 4 parts. The first deals with central planning mythology arising from the complexity and evolution of the social order. Fellow Misesians myself and Prof. Michael Rectenwald will be discussing these themes. Also fellow Misesian Caryn Ann Harlos will discuss how she stood for principle helping keep the Libertarian Party more principled and reflective of people bringing new ideas. The second will deal with intellectual errors leading to antisemitism and conflicts between Jews and Gentiles which unfortunately radiates misguided good vs. evil thinking in all directions. We have a pre-recorded discussion on this with Prof. Walter Block, and I will also further discuss this theme but focusing on Hitler's fallacies and some that is related. The third will deal with medical and scientific mythology arising from the complexity of the biochemical order. Fellow Misesian Antony Sammeroff will explain how much of modern medicine is plagued with mythology, Irene will discuss how the lack of freedom and emerging competition of ideas led to Scientific backwardness in the former Soviet Union, and Celia Farber, who has been deep in the trenches fighting medical tyranny longer than all of us, will discuss the HIV->Death myth and much that is related. Fellow Misesians Mike Ter Maat will discuss his 2024 presidential campaign, Spike Cohen all things relating to spreading liberty, and Reed Coverdale how we can use freedom and decentralization to solve our geo-political messes like the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and Russia-Ukraine war, and the progress along these lines that is being made in New Hampshire's Free State Project. These are just a few of the many themes and speakers that will be joining us this weekend. We thank you all for coming and joining us in our own beachhead in Mises "intellectual battle… the great historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch has plunged us."
