..
hello the great Economist and Slayer of
socialism and every economic fallacy the
great Ludwig vanessis he tells us
history speaks only to those people who
know how to interpret it on the ground
of correct theories
in this video we briefly want to try to
learn something from the first World War
when most intellectuals start to make
sense of History they usually lack two
things one a good understanding of human
nature how human beings are the slightly
smarter troubleistic apes and number two
how the economy actually works and how
it has evolved and came to being and how
it is that Central planning and this
massive course of government
bureaucracies are ultimately responsible
for all of our problems if you think
about every man-made Calamity whether
it's a war or political turmoil it
always involves people using the
government to coerce each other for some
great purpose and this just happens over
and over and over because we simply have
not evolved to live in this massively
complex societies where we have where we
assume that the governments are needed
to coordinate the social order
now we just saw a few simple things in
mind we're going to look at the first
world war and try to learn something
from it how is it that during four years
from 1914 to 1918
Europe's greatest Minds The politicians
the leaders their clergy they fool
themselves into believing that for these
four years they had to run across the
trenches butchering each other
and
100 years later nobody knows anything
about this how could it have been such a
big deal and yet nobody knows anything
about it okay well we're now we're
actually going to learn some vital
history from the first World War
in August 10 1915 British physicist
Henry Mosley who would have probably won
the Nobel Prize that year died in
perhaps the most disastrous error
mankind has thus far made the first
World War 1914-18
bright and Pie is slightly smarter Apes
that had absorbed German French British
Russian identities students fathers
Engineers great minds and experts who
even shared a common European Christian
faith reverted to their tribal ape-like
nature and for God honor flag and
country slaughtered each other leading
to about 18 million deaths and millions
more left invalid 6.5 million just in
France
at 7 30 a.m July 1 1916 the battle of
the song began
on this single day just the British
alone had about 20 000 fatalities and 35
000 wounded
on that day a British soldier was either
killed or wounded on average every
second
the honor of a military career would
lead to disproportionately higher losses
for the upper classes for all
belligerents
Germany's top General Eric ludendorff
would lose two sons as would future
British prime minister Andrew Bonner law
British prime minister at the start of
the war Herbert Asquith lost one
while about 12 of British troops would
die in the war 31 of Oxford's 1913
graduating class would die
this should help abolish the popular
naive myth that politicians are quick to
bring about wars while wanting to avoid
personal loses in them
nonsense unfortunately human beings are
slightly smarter Apes that have been
naturally selected to be vicious killers
and to enjoy violence
Warfare predation was an important
evolutionary strategy and one of the
reasons we are social and have evolved
big brains to begin with
as Stephen Pinker writes
men go to war to get or keep women not
necessarily as a conscious goal of the
Warriors though often it is exactly that
but as the ultimate payoff that allowed
a willingness to fight to evolve
access to women is the limiting factor
on males reproductive success
having two wives can double A Man's
children having three wives can triple
it and so on
the most common Spoils of tribal Warfare
are women
Raiders kill the men abduct the noble
women gang rape them and allocate them
as wives
to be successful in warhunt you need a
strong sense of unity which translates
itself into the strong tribalistic
nationalist militaristic patriotic
Tendencies we are so susceptible to and
has the planet littered with nuclear
weapons and civilized taxpayers
believing we must have them
the bond men make as Warriors may be
stronger than male female love
a female is easily replaceable another
raid
Etc but the loss of that Warrior that
will help get the next female and or
defend you when you only get one chance
at life is probably even more important
just like natural selection has shaped
us to enjoy sex due to the vital
biological evolutionary importance it
has also shaped us to enjoy War violence
and easily segregating ourselves into
the in-group US Good vs out group them
evil
given its importance War patriotism
easily fills us with a great sense of
purpose
England's prime minister during World
War II and national hero Winston
Churchill shows us how inspiring
exciting and purposeful World War one
was to him when he mentioned
I think a curse should rest on me
because I love this war
I know it's smashing and shattering the
lives of thousands every moment and yet
I can't help it I enjoy every second of
it
and in another occasion
my God
this is living history
everything we are doing and saying is
thrilling
why I would not be out of this glorious
delicious War for anything the world
could give me
towards the end of World War II Russia's
Red Army is estimated to have raped over
2 million German women
equally human the Allies Americans
weren't much better and generally saw
the Japanese as an inferior race and
cared little for their suffering or
views as U.S president who needlessly
nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki Harry S
Truman mentions in a letter
the only language they seem to
understand is the one we have been using
to bombard them
when you have to deal with a beast you
have to treat him as a beast
we shouldn't be shocked when men murder
rape and torture or masturbate to
tentacle porn the real miracle that has
taken thousands of years of cultural
legal Evolution to create are the modern
cultural values laws ideologies software
we absorb that program Homo sapiens into
respecting the body property thoughts of
all human beings regardless of age sex
beliefs and race
being the social slightly smarter Apes
that we are fellow humans are our
biggest assets which helps explain the
evolution of altruism compassion as well
as our biggest competitors which helps
us understand our horrendous violence
towards fellow men
during the early days in the lead-up to
World War One there was an atmosphere of
joy and excitement as thousands of young
men celebrated and volunteered for the
coming War which would bring Unity
purpose and Glory
after the war when much of Europe lay in
Ruins many were numb and in a state of
stupor wondering how they could have
fooled themselves into such needless
Carnage
why did this happen
and if it was such a big deal at the
time worth sacrificing so much how come
hardly anybody knows anything about it
today
20 years later Viaduct World War II the
tribalistic slaughter led to over 80
million deaths and what followed was a
cold war that brought the slightly
smarter Apes close to nuclear
Annihilation several times
why were our great leaders and
intellectuals utterly powerless to
prevent the world war one and two
Slaughters and were in fact its
promoters
how can mankind today Build Mint
bogglingly complex microchips airplanes
satellites the internet and so much more
yet still not have figured out something
as simple as peace and always be one
spark away from another worldwide
tribalistic tyrannical Calamity as
coveted Mania is clearly showing
there is something missing from our
understanding of how the world Works
something as Monumental and important as
Darwin's theory of evolution something
that our leading intellectuals and
experts have yet to discover and spread
accordingly
the answer is the following human beings
are slightly smarter vicious Apes whose
instincts are ideally suited to living
in small tribes of less than 100 people
but find themselves relatively lost in
the modern socio-economic order where
things like money profit loss
calculation economic competition and
interest rates coordinate the actions of
billions of human beings all over the
world to create what the Great British
19th century thinker Herbert Spencer
referred to as the social organism
which can also be seen as an incredibly
complex movie-like Matrix that did not
exist 20 000 years ago
tribal Warfare political infighting
coercing each other rape and the law of
the Jungle are things we have been doing
for millions of years and are somewhat
intuitive commercial society and
understanding the aforementioned
economic Concepts which have been around
for less than a few thousand is not
Hayek summarizes
man's instincts were not made for the
kinds of surroundings and for the
numbers in which he now lives
they were adapted to life in the small
roving bands or troops in which the
human race and its immediate ancestors
evolved during the few million years
while the biological constitution of
homo sapiens was being formed
notice how all man-made calamities are
always the result of the masses somehow
coercing each other via government
we have simply not evolved to understand
the economic forces that create
civilization and the immense harm that
too much government can do
this can only be overcome by
understanding how the economy really
works and has evolved in other words by
familiarity with the men known as the
Austrian School of economics
but this will not be a video about that
please see other videos in our channel
for that or read are freely available
the Liberty speaks book Austrian
economics Liberty and emerging worldwide
peace and prosperity Now by visiting
www.libertiespeaks.world
in this presentation we want to briefly
examine how Homo sapiens fools himself
into massive Slaughters
although truth is the first casualty of
war wars are better seen as the result
of widely held myths
the truth is that peace and free trade
is the ideal and thus you need a myth a
widely held but false belief or idea to
cause so many to go along with a war
for example it is obvious that the
religious Slaughters of the past like
the Crusades were unnecessary and based
on mythology
it is the fact that the American masses
believe spending over 1.2 trillion
dollars in military-related stuff is
somehow needed that eventually allows a
lie or exaggeration here and there to
lead to war
there is no myth causing the homo
sapiens in Florida to see the homo
sapiens in the neighboring state of
Georgia as some Potential Threat
the public would rightly ridicule and
ignore anyone saying that
but there is a plethora of myths having
them see fellow Homo sapiens and say
China as something so different from us
that we must potentially Slaughter
next let us try to learn from the first
world war calamity
freedom and the emerging worldwide
division of labor and knowledge kept
creating all this technology and amazing
complexity
but Homo sapiens has little clue how the
economy works and much less how it had
evolved and the vital role that freedom
and private Enterprise not governments
play in coordinating society and sadly
understandably they just used the
growing technology to better organize
the tribal Slaughter
as they have been doing for Generations
mythical Concepts like evil quickly
segregated the Apes into their
respective tribes
the Apes in the US Canada England
believed myths and propaganda that
portrayed the Germans as the evil Huns
Apes so barbaric and somehow possessed
by some militaristic spirit that out of
sheer malice they would sinisterly Bay
in it and chop off the hands of Belgian
babies and crucify Canadian soldiers
below are some World War One anti-german
propaganda posters
this was such a big deal that U.S lawyer
Clarence Darrow who would eventually
become known for defending John T Scopes
in the famous Scopes Monkey Trial about
teaching evolution in schools went to
France in 1915 offering one thousand
dollars thirty thousand dollar in
today's money to anyone who could bring
him one of the Belgian children who
supposedly had their arms amputated by
the evil Germans
obviously he found no such cases and
even if he had it still would have been
a gigantic error myth to label the
Germans in such a manner that could
continue to slaughter
the fact that those creating the
propaganda felt it would help and that
the masses tolerated it and were
inspired roused by it is just reflective
of how Homo sapiens thought at the time
just a couple hundred years earlier in
1693 Americans hung 19 people for
witchcraft in the famed Salem witch
trials
it just takes a while for Homo sapiens
to properly see themselves as they
really are
although today's enlightened masses and
intellectuals can find the World War One
mentality backward we remain lost in
mythology when it comes to seeing all
the human Apes involved in World War II
as equals because we all know that the
World War II Germans and Hitler were the
evil Nazis which is mythical nonsense
yes Hitler had disastrous ideas like his
anti-Semitism socialism and racial
nonsense but again he was a fellow Homo
sapiens acting based on ideas and
erroneous myths which must be understood
in order to prevent their spread
is is all about the ideas how they arise
and spread as mizes reminds us
it is ideas that group men into fighting
factions that press the weapons into
their hands and that determine against
whom and For Whom the weapons shall be
used
it is they alone and not arms that in
the last analysis turn the scales
it is vitally important to keep in mind
that labeling fellow Homo sapiens as
some mythical monstrosity in war happens
all the time in conflicts large enough
simply due to Pure probability and the
still overwhelming non-evolutionary
mindset of most people
and that the formation of such myths
even if at times purposely designed by
newspaper men or politicians is
something that should still be seen as
an understandable and nearly inevitable
myth formation and not a conspiracy
consider the following
among the thousands of violent
Encounters in a conflict as large as a
war between nations statistically you
are bound to have many violent
encounters from which eventually one or
a few will lead to the formation of such
myths
for example a bomb will eventually
damage a non-military Target and kill a
civilian
in retaliation a civilian could
understandably snipe at an occupying
troop which can then lead to a
heightened state of fear alertness and a
soldier mistakenly shooting a teenager
which will lead a mother or old lady to
understandably scream about how evil and
cold-blooded the occupiers are
even just a regular Soldier being the
killer slightly smarter Apes that we are
anyway regardless of nationality may
just enjoy sniping or killing a civilian
this still would not make the soldier
much less his entire nation some best
chillhunts or similar mythical
non-evolutionary creation
then we have the media quickly spreading
the atrocity and then of course the
politicians conveniently picking up the
story to gain sympathy for their heroic
war against the evil doers monsters
the good versus evil-minded politicians
then have more money to give the arms
manufacturers which then also have more
money to help the campaigns of the good
versus evil-minded politicians which
help spread the good versus evil
fallacies to the public in a vicious
cycle that helps start the eventual
conflicts
once the conflicts start the need for
Unity becomes even stronger and those
opposed to it are easily branded as
Traders
once these voices are silenced then the
Apes just intensify the slaughter until
one side claims Victory to the war
all living things including Society are
in continuous cycles of the use and
consumption of existing wealth as
production of New Wealth takes place
under peaceful conditions wealth is
consumed or used to produce homes cars
food and whatever else the freedom of
millions determines to improve their
lives
under conditions of War wealth is
consumed in order to produce weapons and
the destruction of life and property so
an overall continuous shrinking of truly
useful and desirable wealth occurs
only the most economically ignorant
people make the mistake of believing
that war is good for the economy
consider the following absurdity by 2008
Nobel Laureate in economics Paul Krugman
where he makes the case that World War
II is what got the United States out of
the Great Depression
think about World War II right that was
not that was actually negative for
social product spending and yet it
brought us out if we if we discovered
that uh you know space aliens were
planning to attack and we needed a
massive build up to counter the the
space alien threat this slump would be
over in 18 months
how can getting millions of people to
consume wear down existing wealth to
produce weapons which are then used to
destroy fellow human beings and their
property be anything other than an
obvious reduction in life wealth order
krugman's statement is the perfect
example of what mizes once told students
don't be afraid to speak up
remember whatever you say about the
subject and however wrong it might be
the same thing has already been said by
some eminent economist
in any conflict whether it is a Family
Feud or a tribal Slaughter Homo sapiens
has been naturally selected to attempt
to persuade others to their cause group
and this obviously manifests itself in
modernity via the use of the media and
propaganda to Rally the public in
support of the great cause War
all action is based on knowledge
knowledge is expressed and described via
language and thus it is with language
that we can see the formation of deep
hatreds that can ultimately lead to Wars
when World War one broke out to most
Americans the conflict was just a bigger
version of one of the usual European
scuffles which Americans wanted no part
in and seemed so distant
if Germany had been some monstrous
militaristic evil empire out to conquer
the world the U.S would have joined the
Allies immediately but obviously it
wasn't regardless of the Diplomatic
blunders committed by a few of its
bureaucrats
in 1908 a survey of how Americans viewed
immigrant groups had ranked the Germans
as the most admirable
the British won the media War
on August 5 1914 a day after the British
declared war on Germany the British cut
most undersea transatlantic
communication cables linking Germany
with the rest of the world
historian Thomas Fleming writes
the New York Times reported The Cutting
of the main cables on August 6 1914.
the reporter dutifully noted that from
now on all word of happenings in Germany
must pass through hostile countries
Russia on the East France on the west
and England on the North
the consul general of Germany's Chief
Ally Austria-Hungary in one of the
greatest understatements of the 20th
century told the times The Cutting of
that cable may do us great injury
if only one side of the case is given
Prejudice will be created against us
here
on August 2nd 1916 a group of American
correspondents in Berlin signed a
protest complaining that their
dispatches were constantly suppressed
mutilated or delayed by the London
censor
Americans were not getting the vital
half of the most important events of the
war
thanks to British propaganda by the time
the U.S entered the war to many
Americans Germany was no longer the land
of so many of its own immigrants or the
land of Mozart Bach and Beethoven it was
the land of the evil Huns
as Professor Gordon mentions
at all costs Germany and the Allies were
not to be viewed as mere rivals in quest
for Mastery of Europe
quite the contrary the British
propagandists claimed that German policy
followed a long tradition of savage
militarism unparalleled elsewhere they
attempted again and again to portray the
Germans as being Beyond The Pale of
civilized Humanity
but how could the Germans best be
pictured as bestial Huns
atrocities real or imagined proved the
best means of creating the desired image
the British propagandists even stoop
soloist to manufacture evidence in
pursuit of their goal
thus it was widely alleged that German
troops had mutilated babies during their
occupation of Belgium these stories lack
any basis in fact and the British
government admitted that it could not
supply adequate documentation for them
fortunately for the British German
propaganda proved unequal to the task
German pamphlets tended to be stiffly
legalistic and they proved no match for
British appeals to Passion
we obviously see the same patterns
repeat in today's Russia Ukraine war as
Russians are depicted as maniacal
torturers with zero evidence
the bottom line is that we must always
keep our eye on how various myths not
conspiracies evolve and how the very
root of these problems are our
tribalistic human nature and the
numerous economic myths which
understandably cause fellow Homo sapiens
to believe we need these massive and
coercive governments to potentially kill
each other for various reasons
a few quotes about war by the great
Ludwig von mises
Society has arisen out of the works of
Peace the essence of society is
peacemaking
peace and not war is the father of all
things
only economic action has created the
wealth around us labor not the
profession of arms brings happiness
peace builds War destroys
only one thing can conquer war that
liberal attitude of mind which can see
nothing in war but destruction and
Annihilation and which can never wish to
bring about a war because it regards War
as injurious even to the victors
modern war is not a war of Royal armies
it is a war of the peoples a total war
it is a war of states which do not leave
to their subjects any private sphere
they consider the whole population a
part of the Armed Forces
whoever does not fight must work for the
support and Equipment of the army
Army and people are one and the same
the citizens passionately participate in
the war
for it is their state their God who
fights
whoever wishes peace among peoples must
fight statism
