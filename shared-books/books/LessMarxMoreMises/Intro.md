## Preface.

Welcome to the 'Less Marx More Mises' book!. This book-project is a collaborative Open Source project put together by the increasing number of people who feel like they have had the immense fortune of having stumbled upon the proper understanding of economic freedom (and thus how the world works) as provided by the legendary economists known as 'The Austrian School of Economics'. 

Just like the Linux operating system can be continuously improved and propagated by many people, we likewise hope that the Open Source nature of this project motivates others to both improve it and speak on its behalf thus hopefully maximizing its reach.

## Introduction: Worldwide Misesian Free Market Intellectual Revolution or Bust

Most people hope that some great intellectual comes along and provides mankind with a great understanding of the world that can get us on a path to peace and prosperity. Plenty of intellectuals are constantly looking for fame and glory by providing such an understanding.

For example, arguably one of today's "leading intellectuals" is Yuval Noah Harari the author of the wildly popular 'Sapiens:  A Brief History of Humankind' which has over 65,000 mostly glowing reviews and recommended by today's leading personalities like Obama, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. Over seven years after its initial publication in 2015, it is still at the top of numerous amazon.com categories. There is a section titled 'The Capitalist Hell' where he writes:

>"Capitalism has killed millions out of cold indifference coupled with greed."

Mr. Harari is deeply mistaken. He and his book are popular not because they are great but because they reinforce and appeal to the leading fallacies of our day. Surely Pope Urban II's views as he launched the Crusades were popular, and so was Karl Marx's Communist manifesto which is sadly the #2 best-seller in Amazon.com's 'Political Philosophy' category. The world is in chaos, because, as we will sooon show, its 'leading intellectuals' are essentially clueless.  

As we and like-minded friends hope to show, what is more likely to be the case is that the great intellectuals we hope explain the world and get mankind on a path to prosperity lie in the past and are commonly referred to as 'The Austrian School of Economics', but their ideas are just still ahead of our time.
Obama, Gates, Zuckerberg,  Hariri and today's 'leading intellectuals', via their global coercive central plans, are once again, inadvertently, and often times with the best of intentions, destroying civilization. 

As Ludwig von Mises wrote over 100 years ago:

>"The intellectual leaders of the peoples have produced and propagated the fallacies which are on the point of destroying liberty and Western civilization. The intellectuals alone are responsible for the mass slaughters which are the characteristic mark of our century. They alone can reverse the trend and pave the way for a resurrection of freedom."

Mises also tells us:

>"The flowering of human society depends on two factors: the intellectual power of outstanding men to conceive sound social and economic theories..."

This part has already been done by the so-called 'Austrians'. Mises continues:

>"and the ability of these or other men to make these ideologies palatable to the majority."

It is this latter part which the authors of this book and like-minded friends all over the world believe we must focus on.

Among the numerous members of the so-called 'Austrian School' economists, we have chosen Ludwig von Mises as the standard bearer for our book and theme because his achievements and 'ethos' make him the ideal role model for those of us looking for the wisdom and inspiration needed to quickly get mankind on a path to prosperity. Arguably no single human being in the last 120 years has done so much, both intellectually, and in terms of political manouvers, to save mankind from the economic ignorance that led to Communism and remains the source of virtually all of our current socioeconomic problems, than Mises.


Imagine you had a time machine and went back in time about 300 years to Salem, Massachusetts during the famed Salem witch trials where 19 women were hanged for witchcraft, and told people that the world could function much better if there was no slavery, that women should have the same rights and freedoms as men, that homosexuality should not be criminalized and seen as part of homo sapiens, and that six million years ago we had a common ancestor with chimpanzees (we’ll assume they know what chimps are). People would see you as some devilish monstrosity spreading heretical ideas and quickly “conspire” to kill you. Would this mean that the people of the time were somehow dumb or malicious? Or members of some “vast conspiracy” of “bad guys” or “special interests” intent on taking away your freedoms? Of course not. The people would be fellow homo sapiens acting based on the prevailing myths and incentive structures of the times. If by our modern standards pretty much everything about how people saw the world 300 years ago could be understood as myths, in other words, as “widely held but false beliefs or ideas”, why should we not be open to the idea that we too are likewise immersed in mythology?

Since myths are ideas, how do we discover the best ideas, determine their validity, usefulness and spread them? How do we discover the best information with which to guide our actions and order mankind?

Among numerous great free-market economists of the ‘Austrian School’, Mises' pupil and 1974 Nobel Laureate F.A. Hayek([Mick Jagger’s favorite economist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pCZo6iXOfk)), in some of his seminal writings like ‘The Use of Knowledge in Society’ and the aptly titled ‘Competition as a discovery procedure’ helped us realize that the economic competition which emerges from people’s freedom to choose among competing alternatives or ideas is how we motivate the discovery and spread of superior information and subsequent order throughout society. This process of ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ inadvertently turns mankind into a global supercomputer as entrepreneurs via the companies they create are motivated to innovate and have to copy and thus spread each other’s innovations due to billions of minds freely trading their life-sustaining wealth for what they calculate to be best.

Coercion, whether it is by the patriarchy, slave-master, Church, and ultimately government, is not only a burden to those being coerced, but also destroys this wonderful mechanism of ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ which is what has discovered and spread the superior information which replaced erroneous mythology and continuously reordered mankind into increasingly more technologically advanced, productive, and prosperous states. This helps us understand how as the coercive and thus competition-immune-monopolistic decision-making power of the Catholic Church was reduced and individual freedom increased in Europe so did emerging ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ and resulting technological advancements thus taking Western civilization to prominence, but as the social order got mind-bogglingly complex in the late 1800s and Socialist-competition-immune-Central-Planning mythology arose, freedom and emerging ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ was destroyed leading to immense suffering and technological stagnation in Communist countries like the former Soviet Union and pre-Capitalist China.


Since economic ignorance is the root of our socioeconomic problems, per Mises, we feel it is our "civic duty" to help fellow citizens overcome such ignorance. Mises also writes:

>"Liberalism is rationalistic. It maintains that it is possible to convince the immense majority that peaceful cooperation within the framework of society better serves their rightly understood interests than mutual battling and social disintegration. It has full confidence in man’s reason. It may be that this optimism is unfounded and that the liberals have erred. But then there is no hope left for mankind’s future."

Mises also:

>"The masses follow the lead of the people we call educated. Once convince these, and the game is won."

In other words, we have to believe that we can educate "the immense majority" even if it proves to be futile, otherwise "there is no hope left for mankind's future". Different people have different ideas regarding how to improve the world. Some think we need to be more religious, better Christians or Muslims. Some think people with different political ideologies should segregate themselves accordingly. Some feel like there will always be wars, corrupt or "bad" politicians, and chaos and this is just the way things will always be and we just have to hope for the best. We are Misesians in the sense that we belive that Mises was right not just in his insights regarding the economy, the evolution of society and more, but also in his strategy of economic education as the key for worldwide peace and prosperity. He writes:

>"If we want to avoid the destruction of Western civilization and the relapse into primitive wretchedness, we must change the mentality of our fellow citizens. We must make them realize what they owe to the much vilified "economic freedom," the system of free enterprise and capitalism."

Also:

>"Economics deals with society's fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen."

And again:

>"It is a fateful error on the part of our most valuable contemporaries to believe that economics can be left to specialists...The issues of society's economic organization are every citizen's business. To master them to the best of one's ability is the duty of everyone."

If we are to quickly save mankind and reach the prosperity we are truly capable of, those of us who've had the miraculous fortune of stumbling upon Mises and fellow 'Austrian School'-thinkers must succeed at spreading their ideas before it is too late. We must find, join, and grow the people who are thoroughly convinced that such quick prosperity can be achieved and thus become beacons of hope and economic education. We must join Mises in the trenches and go over the parapet in his "intellectual battle" against the economic ignorance that threatens civilization.

Mises: 

>"Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders; no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction. Therefore, everyone, in his own interests, must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle. None can stand aside with unconcern; the interests of everyone hang on the result. Whether he chooses or not, every man is drawn into the great historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch has plunged us." (Mises, 1981)

This book's "Hayekian" focus on how information arises and coordinates the social order provides a framework to pack many vital economic concepts into a short book. We will explain concepts we feel everyone should understand like 1) the Mises-Hayek explanation for the impossibility of Socialism-Communism, information which could have prevented millions of people from falling for the horrendous Socialist-Communist disasters of the 20th century which still affect Cuba, North Korea, and all of us to various degrees. 2) The 'Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle' which explains how governments all over the world via misguided central bank policy create the booms and busts which plague economies leading to socioeconomic chaos and political unrest. 3) The foolishness of mainstream 'Keynesian Economics' and leading mainstream economists like 2008 Nobel Laureate in Economics Paul Krugman. 4) Founder of the 'Austrian School' Carl Menger's explanation of the evolution of money which is a VITAL concept needed to make sense of how the socioeconomic order works, has evolved, and just as importantly, why mankind remains lost in economic ignorance and resulting socioeconomic chaos. 5) How mankind's ignorance of how the socioeconomic order evolved led to Socialist-Communist mythology resulting in world-wide Communist revolutions and the vital role that Ludwig von Mises played in nearly single-handedly saving civilization. 6) Many other related insights from 'The Austrian School' economists.
