The Liberty Speaks organization seeks to educate people on the vital link between liberty and its emerging socioeconomic prosperity. We are Misesians to the core. The great free-market economist of the so-called ‘Austrian School’, Ludwig von Mises, believed that economic education is the key to solving mankind’s problems. He passionately tells us:

>“all reasonable men are called upon to familiarize themselves with the teachings of economics. This is, in our age, the primary civic duty… Economics deals with society’s fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen.”
