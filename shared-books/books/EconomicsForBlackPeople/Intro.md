## Preface.

This book-project is a collaborative Open Source project put together by the Freemarketeers writing group, a group of people who feel like they have had the immense fortune of having stumbled upon the proper understanding of the functioning and evolution of the socio-economic order as provided by the legendary economists known as 'The Austrian School of Economics'. 

Like all titles published by the Freemarketeers this book includes and thus repeats vital economic and historical wisdom, which is then followed by "race" related content specific to this title.

Just like the Linux operating system can be continuously improved and propagated by many people, we likewise hope that the Open Source nature of this project motivates others to both improve it and speak on its behalf thus hopefully maximizing its reach.

## Economic ignorance is the root of all of our problems, especially our "racial" ones.

Most of us associate 'natural selection' with people like Charles Darwin and the biological world of animals and living things, but natural selection also evolved the socioeconomic order and things like religions, laws, customs, language, and especially for our purposes, the many socioeconomic institutions that make up our modern economies. And, very importantly, it is also indispensable for understanding our geopolitical conflicts as well as their history. In other words, at a fundamental level natural selection creates both the biological as well as the socioeconomic orders and is indispensable for understanding how they have come into existence and behave. As Hayek writes:

>“We understand now that all enduring structures above the level of the simplest atoms, and up to the brain and society, are the results of, and can be explained only in terms of, processes of selective evolution…”

Most people fear the concepts of natural selection and evolution with good reason, we don’t really understand them, especially when it comes to the concept of race and socioeconomic achievement. Popular phrases associated with evolution like Herbert Spencer’s “survival of the fittest” can scare us and keep us away from learning these vital subjects. Racist and erroneous ideologies like the ones that flourished in Hitler’s Germany were also heavily influenced by faulty evolutionary thought and still play a significant role today.

We are members of a matrix-'Social Organism' whose workings hardly anyone really understands (unless you have heard of Ludwig von Mises), and whose evolution is understood by an even smaller number of people (Menger and Hayek are needed here). Standing on Mises' shoulders, who provided him with a superb explanation of the workings of the economy and thus all aspects of 'the market process'(money-prices-'interest rates'-etc.) and much, much, much, much more, Hayek would go on to explain how in a few thousand years culture and 'the market process' had co-evolved to transform homo sapiens, from tribes of slightly smarter vicious apes, into today's massively complex global socioeconomic order-'Social Organism' thus arguably becoming the first person in the history of mankind to provide a complete evolutionary framework for understanding how the entire world works. Ignorance of how the socioeconomic order works and has evolved is what keeps plunging the slightly smarter apes, regardless of their "experts" and "great leaders", into tribalistic world wars and socioeconomic disasters like the recent Coronavirus-related chaos, Russia-Ukraine war, and financial crisis. Either Spencer-Menger-Mises-Hayek-friends' monumental contributions quickly reach the general public or mankind will soon prove to be an evolutionary dead-end. It is that simple. Someday, if mankind does not destroy itself, 'The Austrian School' economists-thinkers will be as well-known as Darwin is today. 

Notice how all man-made calamities, from religious slaughters, to world wars, to political chaos, are always, always! the result of large groups of homo sapiens coercing each other via government, forcing each other to go along with the prevailing myths of the times. We have simply not evolved to understand the economic forces that create civilization, the vital need for freedom and privatization, and the immense harm that too much government can do. Supposedly the Dodo bird quickly went extinct because it had not evolved to recognize humans as potential dangers, we similarly just line up for ‘central planning’ and government coordinated self-destruction over and over and over and over.

It should be easy to realize that all human beings are such slightly smarter apes who grow up absorbing a continuously evolving culture-language-"identity"-ideas-myths which then leads them to act in ways that lead to disorder via conflict-war, or order via peace and prosperity. As Mises tells us:

>"It is ideas that group men into fighting factions, that press the weapons into their hands, and that determine against whom and for whom the weapons shall be used. It is they alone, and not arms, that, in the last analysis, turn the scales."

When a lion takes over a pride and kills the cubs so that the females will once again be ready to mate, we don’t say that the lion is “evil”, we rightly understand the complex evolutionary factors leading to such actions. It is likewise important to look at our socioeconomic disasters using an evolutionary lens that is free of "blame" and full of sympathy and understanding. Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Churchill, Roosevelt, Fauci, etc. were not "evil", which is itself a mythical linguistic construct inherited from more religious times, they were fellow homo sapiens adored by their respective masses who absorbed horrendous ideas or myths propagated by scholars arising from the complexity of the economy as in the case of Socialism (Hitler-Lenin-Mao-Roosevelt-etc.), and the biochemical order as in the case of CovidMania and resulting coercive lockdowns and damaging vaccinations and more (Fauci). As Hayek tells us:

>"It is necessary to realize that the sources of many of the most harmful agents in this world are often not evil men but high-minded idealists, and that in particular the foundations of totalitarian barbarism have been laid by honourable and well-meaning scholars who never recognized the offspring they produced." (Hayek F. A., 1973, p. 70)


>"Most people are still unwilling to face the most alarming lesson of modern history: that the greatest crimes of our time have been committed by governments that had the enthusiastic support of millions of people who were guided by moral impulses. It is simply not true that Hitler or Mussolini, Lenin or Stalin, appealed only to the worst instincts of their people: they also appealed to some of the feelings which also dominate contemporary democracies." (Hayek F. A., 1976, p. 134)

The great war historian and senior editor of antiwar.com, Scott Horton, shared an Instagram quote that read:

>"To get one to commit the greatest atrocities, you do not need to convince evil men to do evil. You need to convince good men to believe they are doing good. The best men I have ever met have done the worst things I have ever seen."  -- US Marine.

Mises again:

>"Neither as judges allotting praise and blame nor as avengers seeking out the guilty should we face the past. We seek truth, not guilt; we want to know how things came about to understand them, not to issue condemnations."


The centuries of slavery, religious slaughters, persecution of minorities, and all man-made calamities were obviously the result, not of mythical "evil" or "madness", but of the ideas and myths held by the slightly smarter apes at the time and the mistaken need to coerce each other, and as long as the masses remain lost in erroneous mythology, democracy obviously does little good. Hayek:

>"Perhaps the fact that we have seen millions voting themselves into complete dependence on a tyrant has made our generation understand that to choose one's government is not necessarily to secure freedom."

It is obvious that we should focus on the ideas instead of vilifying people and assuming sinister motives or madness as the source of our problems, yet the fact that this goes largely unnoticed as we constantly segregate ourselves along political-tribal lines is further evidence that we are such dangerous slightly smarter apes, and just as important, how little a role "reason" plays in creating and sustaining civilization. Focusing on the actions of individual men is irrelevant compared to the evolutionary processes that create the ideas, incentive structures and circumstances under which he acts. Without the above men's evolutionary insights, as Spencer tells us: 

>"It is as though a child, seeing for the first time a tree from which a gardener is here cutting off a branch and there pruning away smaller parts, should regard the gardener, the only visible agent, as the creator of the whole structure: knowing nothing about the agency of sun and rain, air and soil. Undeveloped intelligences cannot recognize the results of slow, silent, invisible causes."

The complete evolutionary worldview provided by 'The Austrians', arguably reaching its zenith or completion with F.A. Hayek, is still so ridiculously far ahead of our time and mainstream intellectuals that even today's leading thinkers, like renowned popular science writer Matt Ridley, by their own admission are 'still catching up with him'. Ridley humbly acknowledges this in a 2011 speech where he mentions:

>"As someone who came to Fredrick von Hayek comparatively late in life, I'm still catching up with him...Indeed, many of the insights I thought I had discovered in my own readings and writings on the frontier of evolutionary biology and economics it turns out Hayek had long before me...It's Hayek who first puts it all together." - [Matt Ridley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG-grkJPU8Q)

So how did Hayek 'put it all together'?. Easy. Hayek realized that all living things require precise information to sustain-coordinate-expand their order. If one understands how information arises and guides the transformations of matter that lead to the biological and social orders, then one understands how the entire living world works. It is that simple! Hayek's focus on information helps us understand not just all life and resulting society, but what Menger-Mises-Hayek referred to as 'complex phenomena' like the environment, climate, medicine, nutrition, economy, mind, history, etc.. Basically, if it is superior information one is looking for, whether it is how to order 8 billion human beings in a manner that maximizes prosperity, our health, how to take care of the environment, or discovering THE TRUTH!, Hayek's focus on economic ['Competition as a Discovery Procedure'](https://mises.org/library/competition-discovery-procedure-0) provides us the best mechanism for discovering such information which includes busting and steering us away from dangerous mythology.

Most people hope that some great intellectual comes along and provides mankind with a great understanding of the world that can get us on a path to peace and prosperity. Plenty of intellectuals are constantly looking for fame and glory by providing such an understanding.

For example, arguably one of today's "leading intellectuals" is Yuval Noah Harari the author of the wildly popular 'Sapiens:  A Brief History of Humankind' which has over 65,000 mostly glowing reviews and recommended by today's leading personalities like Obama, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. Over seven years after its initial publication in 2015, it is still at the top of numerous amazon.com categories. There is a section titled 'The Capitalist Hell' where he writes:

>"Capitalism has killed millions out of cold indifference coupled with greed."

Mr. Harari is deeply mistaken. He and his book are popular not because they are great but because they reinforce and appeal to the leading fallacies of our day. Surely Pope Urban II's views as he launched the Crusades were popular, and so was Karl Marx's Communist manifesto which is sadly the #2 best-seller in Amazon.com's 'Political Philosophy' category. The world is in chaos, because, as we will sooon show, its 'leading intellectuals' are essentially clueless.  

As we and like-minded friends hope to show, what is more likely to be the case is that the great intellectuals we hope explain the world and get mankind on a path to prosperity lie in the past and are commonly referred to as 'The Austrian School of Economics', but their ideas are just still ahead of our time. Obama, Gates, Zuckerberg,  Hariri and today's 'leading intellectuals', via their global coercive central plans, are once again, inadvertently, and often times with the best of intentions, destroying civilization. 

As Ludwig von Mises wrote over 100 years ago:

>"The intellectual leaders of the peoples have produced and propagated the fallacies which are on the point of destroying liberty and Western civilization. The intellectuals alone are responsible for the mass slaughters which are the characteristic mark of our century. They alone can reverse the trend and pave the way for a resurrection of freedom."

Mises also tells us:

>"The flowering of human society depends on two factors: the intellectual power of outstanding men to conceive sound social and economic theories..."

This part has already been done by the so-called 'Austrians'. Mises continues:

>"and the ability of these or other men to make these ideologies palatable to the majority."

It is this latter part which the authors of this book and like-minded friends all over the world believe we must focus on.


Since economic ignorance is the root of our socioeconomic problems, per Mises, we feel it is our "civic duty" to help fellow citizens overcome such ignorance. Mises also writes:

>"Liberalism is rationalistic. It maintains that it is possible to convince the immense majority that peaceful cooperation within the framework of society better serves their rightly understood interests than mutual battling and social disintegration. It has full confidence in man’s reason. It may be that this optimism is unfounded and that the liberals have erred. But then there is no hope left for mankind’s future."

Mises also:

>"The masses follow the lead of the people we call educated. Once convince these, and the game is won."

In other words, we have to believe that we can educate "the immense majority" even if it proves to be futile, otherwise "there is no hope left for mankind's future". Different people have different ideas regarding how to improve the world. Some think we need to be more religious, better Christians or Muslims. Some think people with different political ideologies should segregate themselves accordingly. Some feel like there will always be wars, corrupt or "bad" politicians, and chaos and this is just the way things will always be and we just have to hope for the best. We are Misesians in the sense that we belive that Mises was right not just in his insights regarding the economy, the evolution of society and more, but also in his strategy of economic education as the key for worldwide peace and prosperity. He writes:

>"If we want to avoid the destruction of Western civilization and the relapse into primitive wretchedness, we must change the mentality of our fellow citizens. We must make them realize what they owe to the much vilified "economic freedom," the system of free enterprise and capitalism."

Also:

>"Economics deals with society's fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen."

And again:

>"It is a fateful error on the part of our most valuable contemporaries to believe that economics can be left to specialists...The issues of society's economic organization are every citizen's business. To master them to the best of one's ability is the duty of everyone."

If we are to quickly save mankind and reach the prosperity we are truly capable of, those of us who've had the miraculous fortune of stumbling upon Mises and fellow 'Austrian School'-thinkers must succeed at spreading their ideas before it is too late. We must find, join, and grow the people who are thoroughly convinced that such quick prosperity can be achieved and thus become beacons of hope and economic education. We must join Mises in the trenches and go over the parapet in his "intellectual battle" against the economic ignorance that threatens civilization.

Mises: 

>"Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders; no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction. Therefore, everyone, in his own interests, must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle. None can stand aside with unconcern; the interests of everyone hang on the result. Whether he chooses or not, every man is drawn into the great historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch has plunged us." (Mises, 1981)

This book's "Hayekian" focus on how information arises and coordinates the social order provides a framework to pack many vital economic concepts into a short book. We will explain concepts we feel everyone should understand like 1) the Mises-Hayek explanation for the impossibility of Socialism-Communism, information which could have prevented millions of people from falling for the horrendous Socialist-Communist disasters of the 20th century which still affect Cuba, North Korea, and all of us to various degrees. 2) The 'Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle' which explains how governments all over the world via misguided central bank policy create the booms and busts which plague economies leading to socioeconomic chaos and political unrest. 3) The foolishness of mainstream 'Keynesian Economics' and leading mainstream economists like 2008 Nobel Laureate in Economics Paul Krugman. 4) Founder of the 'Austrian School' Carl Menger's explanation of the evolution of money which is a VITAL concept needed to make sense of how the socioeconomic order works, has evolved, and just as importantly, why mankind remains lost in economic ignorance and resulting socioeconomic chaos. 5) How mankind's ignorance of how the socioeconomic order evolved led to Socialist-Communist mythology resulting in world-wide Communist revolutions and the vital role that Ludwig von Mises played in nearly single-handedly saving civilization. 6) Many other related insights from 'The Austrian School' economists. 


After summarizing the socioeconomic wisdom of 'The Austrians' we will apply it to our racial problems which are ultimately outgrowths of economic ignorance similar to how Communist mythology wrecked the lives of millions of bright and well-intentioned people.

### Intro to discussion on racial problems.


If you are going to have a civil war-unrest you need some simplistic ideas which can segregate-polarize the economically ignorant public. To one economically ignorant group of fellow homo sapiens (the political "Left"-"Democrats"-"Liberals"), the political "Right"-"Republicans"-"Conservatives" is just the "racist white man who uses capitalism to exploit and maintain the status quo for his benefit and Donald Trump and all the other white 'conservative' leaders are the perfect embodiment of this fact". That's pretty much it. It is so-called "identity politics", where the "racist white man" and his antiquated values(religion) oppresses or discriminates against various groups-"identities"(women-minorities-gays) and overturning such supposed political-economic oppression is what is needed to fix the world's problems by sharing more wealth and funding social programs (competition-less government monopolies) that treat everyone fairly-equitably. The fact that many whites understandably make the erroneous assumption that their blood-race-religion was a very significant factor in the recent emergence of civilization only helps add fuel to the Left-Right polarization-hatreds. Many whites-liberals, with the best of intentions, might be ashamed of the imperialist past of their ancestors or of the racism of their parents-uncles-friends-etc. or their own "shameful" preference for perhaps blue-eyed blondes and erroneously believe that such a past-racism-preference is a significant factor in the relative underachievement-problems of other groups-minorities. A well intentioned economically ignorant person can easily find some "racist CEO" who discriminates based on race and "voilà! this racism is the root of the problems!". This sort of collective sense of guilt is what allows Black Lives Matter rioters to destroy cities virtually unopposed. Economic ignorance inevitably leads both blacks and whites to increasingly see whatever racism might exist as an increasingly significant problem to fix, via massive government-monopoly-coercion of course as can be seen by today's Democratic party's prominent focus on 'racial justice'. Both groups are wrong. It should be easy to see that the explosion in relative human prosperity and technology mankind has stumbled upon during the last 200 years has little to do with biological differences and much more to do with the expansion of the global 'division of labor and information'-free-trade-competition-Capitalism, etc. If a human being can grow up and learn something as complex as a language, which can take even the brightest of people years to master, everyone has more than enough intelligence to understand the basics of how freedom-privatization-free-(trade-movement) are the keys to rapid socioeconomic progress. Clever economic education-marketing is obviously the key.
