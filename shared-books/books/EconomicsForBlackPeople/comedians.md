### Black comedians are the real black intellectuals.


In order to understand race in America one can take America’s political correctness, economic ignorance, wishful thinking, psychobabble, and mix it up really well to create a cocktail of bullshit reasons, or you can simply watch black comedians tell you the real truth about race in America.

Examples of this wisdom can be seen in Chris Rock’s many great and down to earth performances.  In his “Bring the Pain” performance he classified African Americans into two groups, the niggas and regular black folks. He joked that:

>“There is black people, and there is niggas…and niggas have got to go!…Can’t go to a movie the first week it comes out, why? cuz niggas are shooting at the screen… I love black people but I hate niggas… boy I wish they’d let me join the Ku Klux Klan. Shit, I’d do a drive by from here to Brooklyn….Niggas always want some credit for shit they’re supposed to do… a nigga will say some shit like “I take care of my kids!”, you’re supposed to you dumb mother fucker!… “I ain’t never been to jail”, what!, you want a cookie?! You are not supposed to go to jail you low-expectation-having-mother-fucker!…If you’re black, you get more respect coming out of jail than you do coming out of school… “Hey man, I got out of school, I got my Masters” “So what bitch. You punk ass bitch!…So I’m supposed to listen to your punk ass now! Fuck you nigga, fuck you. So what you gotta masters. So what you gotta fucking masters…Let me ask you this, let me ask you this. Can you kick my ass?!?!?”

In his “Never Scared” performance:

>“During slavery they used to take the biggest, strongest slaves and breed them And try their best to make big, strong, superslaves… There is evidence of that today like the NFL… The NFL stands for “Nigger Fucking Large”… This is why black people dominate every physical activity in the United States of America…We’re only ten percent of the population, we’re 90% of the final four. We fucking dominate all this shit…Basketball, baseball, football, boxing, track, even golf and tennis. As soon as they make a heated hockey ring we are going to take that shit too… Mother-fuck Wayne Gretzky! Wait till you see LeBron in some skates!... He ain’t even gonna have a stick. He’s gonna smack the puck with his dick!”


As Chris mentioned these things, the largely black audience cheered and agreed.


Why would “Niggas always want some credit for shit they’re supposed to do”? I think the answer to this question has something to do with the following: If you were a millionaire and could afford to have servants do your laundry and other things that we usually have to do out of necessity, and all of a sudden, while still being a millionaire, you now have to do the laundry yourself and forego all of these other enjoyable things that you could be doing, wouldn’t it be a bigger sacrifice for you to do laundry than for the average person who does not have better options and is already used to the tedium of doing laundry? The point I’m trying to make is that it makes sense for the ‘nigga’ to feel more pain for doing the things the average person has to do because he usually does not have to do them. Deep down inside, for various reasons already hinted at, he thinks he is superior or has got more “game” than others which means someone else down the pecking order should be doing this. We are all susceptible to this sort of mentality. Chris Rock’s stereotyping of African Americans into regular black folks and niggas is not really about people, it is more about a mindset. The ‘nigga’ mindset can just as easily be referred to as the alpha male mindset. It is a mindset which everyone can relate to regardless “race”.
