### Economic ignorance is the root of “racism” fears.


Before going any further let’s review the following important facts:

1.     Individual freedom and privatization are the keys to economic prosperity.

2.     The market process and its socioeconomic institutions were not designed by people, they were naturally selected, and that it is the market process and a process of cultural evolution that carried Europeans to dominance in the last few centuries and not something inherent in their genes.

3.     Human beings are tribal creatures who are easily susceptible to violence, us vs. them mentality, trying to see ourselves as superior to others, or at the very least, easily susceptible to these.


At the core of all the hoopla and negativity surrounding the concept of “racism”, lays yet again, economic ignorance. If black people were as productive and economically well-off as whites, in other words, if blacks were 100% convinced that their ability to prosper was unaffected by whatever dislike or fear some whites might have of them, the concept of “racism” would not be as big a deal as it is today. But obviously this is not the case. Blacks, or so-called minorities in general, fear some sort of economic discrimination which they feel would then be detrimental to them, and is in fact seen by most Americans as one of the main reasons why the living standards of blacks-minorities can be so far behind whites-majority. In order to combat this feared potential economic discrimination, minorities, as well as well-intentioned whites and peoples of all backgrounds, overwhelmingly call on government to make sure that:

1. We punish-brainwash-culturally change the mindset of people who might discriminate based on race-culture-background-sex-etc.

2. We redistribute wealth to make up for the alleged economic damage that the majority of whites do to African Americans and other minorities via their evil racism or discrimination. This does not happen directly via taxing whites to give money directly to minorities, it happens via public services like education and various welfare schemes where by being poorer, African Americans tend to pay less in taxes compared to what gets spent on them and so on.

Thus far I have discussed ignorance of the socioeconomic forces that have shaped the social order and the big-government ideology that results from it as being the main culprit in so much suffering and lack of progress, but the aforementioned (1,2...) reasons for government growth also play an important role in the socioeconomic problems we face. If privatization and the dismantling of government are what is needed to bring about a rapidly increasing socioeconomic prosperity, we also need to alleviate the fears which lead so many people, especially blacks-minorities and their well-intentioned supporters, to call on government to curb all the race-related or motivated legislation and growth of government programs.

If white American’s inadvertent move towards Socialism wasn’t bad enough, African Americans are much more susceptible to socialist share-the-wealth ideology. If socialist ideology arises out of our fears of freedom and that the ‘haves’ will naturally exploit the ‘have-nots’, then it makes perfect sense that African Americans and other “minorities” are even more inclined towards Socialism and government enforced economic equality. Given our usual tribal understanding of the world, many blacks easily reason that some white’s dislike or discrimination towards them is the main reason why blacks have problems. Many tend to see economic development as a sort of foot-race, and many people(blacks and whites) figure that since they started way back it is ok or “fair” that the government takes from the haves to give to the have-less and bring about equality. This is all just sort of obvious; if one yearns for equality and you are nearer the bottom, then to reach this equality you need the big ape government to enforce such equality. In the back of many people’s minds is the fear that should it not be for our “equal opportunity” laws and forced integration, whites would hog all the jobs and make things worse for blacks, and that without things like public education bringing about equality in education whites will always have better education and blacks will always be behind/etc. On and on and on and on, every fear or concern that leads to socialist policies we should expect to see in higher proportion amongst blacks/minorities, not because it is part of their nature or because the color of their skin, but because of historical circumstances, various incentives and a few other things. As the US continues its economic downward spiral and calls to cut government spending increase, it is inevitable that minorities, especial African Americans, see this as an attack on their wellbeing, which can lead to riots and a further acceleration of America’s socioeconomic decline.
