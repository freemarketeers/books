Our modern understanding of evolution and genetics shows just how much alike all human beings are, this is wonderful and a key to our potential prosperity, but there are some slight differences given the fact that various populations have adapted to slightly different environments.

Although born a week earlier than white or Asian babies, black babies are more mature in terms of bone development. According to French physician Marcelle Geber who studied Ugandan children in 1957 “The motor development was greatly in advance of that of European infants of the same age. It was paralleled by advanced adaptivity, language, and personal social behaviour.” In his book “Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports And Why We’re Afraid To Talk About It”, Jon Entine summarizes some of the differences:

>“The faster maturation of black babies continues throughout life even when blacks are poorer and eat a less healthy diet. They demonstrate superior eye-hand coordination, hold their necks erect earlier by a couple of weeks, walk earlier by about a month, and enter puberty earlier by about a year.

>“I think the reason [for precocity in black infants] may be partially biological,” notes William Frankenburg, a professor of pediatrics and preventive medicine at the University of Colorado. In the mid-1960s Frankenburg and fellow researcher Joe Dodds developed a standardized measure of thirty gross motor skills of infants, including throwing, jumping, kicking, and coordination, that is now used in more than fifty countries. The researchers were intrigued to find that black children as young as six months developed significantly more quickly than the white infants.

>“When I first looked at the data I thought, ‘Those were interesting but maybe not replicable kind of findings, perhaps chance findings,’” says Dodds. The researchers, who have worked together for more than twenty years, then crunched the numbers on thousands more children. Once again, they were flabbergasted. “There were no items that the white children were doing earlier than the black children in the first year of life,” Dodds notes. Even by age four, blacks had an edge in fifteen categories while whites bested blacks in only three.” (Entiene, p. 250)


West Africans and their descendants like Haitians, Jamaicans and African Americans, have also been shown to have a higher proportion of so called “fast-twitch” muscle fiber which helps explain their utter dominance in the world of sprinting. While discussing sports in general, Entine mentions in an interview:

>“Different populations... do better at certain sports, not only because of cultural reasons...but also because of genetic reasons. East Africans have a body type that tends to contribute to them dominating in things like...long distance running... West Africans (African Americans are almost exclusively of West African ancestry) tend to dominate in sports that require quick jumping and running, everything from the hundred meters to basketball and football. Whites dominate in the strength events. These are all to some degree circumscribed by the body types that evolved in very different climates.”

On general black people have bigger penises too. For example, for condom width the World Health Organization recommends different sizes for different parts of the world. 49 millimeter width for Asia, 52 millimeters for North America and Europe, and 53 millimeters for Africa. Testicle size/weight also varies significantly among populations. 24 grams for Asians, 29 to 33 grams for Caucasians, and 50 grams for Africans. As Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha write:

>“These are dangerous waters we’re swimming in, dear reader, suggesting that culture, environment, and behavior can be reflected in anatomy—genital anatomy, at that. But any serious biologist or physician knows there are anatomical differences expressed racially. Despite the hiar-trigger sensitivity of these issues, not to consider racial background in the diagnosis and treatment of disease would be unethical.” (Ryan & Jetha, p. 241)
