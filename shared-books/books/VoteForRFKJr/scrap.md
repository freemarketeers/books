The fellow homo sapiens who had absorbed a 'Nazi' identity like Hitler would vilify the Jews, and the fellow homo sapiens who had absorbed a 'Jewish Identity' would vilify the Nazis. An early example of Hitler's nonsense was:

>"For us, it is a problem of whether our nation can ever recover its health, whether the Jewish spirit can ever really be eradicated. Don't be misled into thinking you can fight a disease without killing the carrier, without destroying the bacillus. Don't think you can fight racial tuberculosis without taking care to rid the nation of the carrier of that racial tuberculosis. This Jewish contamination will not subside, this poisoning of the nation will not end, until the carrier himself, the Jew, has been banished from our midst." (Hitler, 1920)

But it is vitally important that we also see how many Jews would spread a religious-like anti German psychosis as well. Consider the following. Over 5 years before the Second World War broke out on Sept 1st, 1939, on January, 1934 Vladimir Jabotinsky, one of the most popular and influential Jews of the 20th century preached:

>“For months now the struggle against Germany is waged by each Jewish community, at each conference, in all our syndicates, and by each Jew all over the world. There is reason to believe that our part in this struggle has general value. We will trigger a spiritual and material war of all the world against Germany’s ambitions to become once again a great nation, to recover lost territories and colonies. But our Jewish interests demand the complete destruction of Germany. Collectively and individually, the German nation is a threat to us Jews.”
