## Concluding remarks.


If one looks at homo sapiens during the last 100,000 years it is easy to see that civilization has been a sort of cultural mutation, an anomaly (although one that was likely bound to happen). This miracle needs further miracles to happen. It was already miraculous that Mises-Hayek-friends managed to save Western Civilization in the 1920s-1940s.

Most of us mistakenly believe that the best thing we could do for ourselves is to work hard, be productive, etc. Sounds reasonable right? Yes and no, although those things are important, perhaps it is even more important to join Mises in his "intellectual battle". If mankind proves to be an evolutionary dead end in the near future as certainly looks to be the case, it will not be because of the "evil" or clueless politicians and public. It will be because those who have had the fortune of stumbling upon these and like-minded men's ideas failed to educate fellow citizens.

Mankind's problems are obviously the result of the economic ignorance of the public which then, via democracy, reflects itself in the disastrous competition-less central planning bureaucracies the well-intentioned public always fall for. It is their ignorance, that of your neighbor, former self, family members, etc. that is the root of the problems, not whatever slightly smarter ape they vote for and the inevitable corruption that emerges in the competition-immune bureaucracies-Priesthoods. And the very very very root of this ignorance, as especially shown by Menger, is the fact that money and emerging 'market process' and 'Social Organism', are "indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design" and hardly anyone in the planet, and much less so people of significant influence, are aware of this. We are flying blind!  

Mises:

>"... in the field of social organization and economic policies. Here the best theories are useless if not supported by public opinion. They cannot work if not accepted by a majority of the people. Whatever the system of government may be, there cannot be any question of ruling a nation lastingly on the ground of doctrines at variance with public opinion. In the end the philosophy of the majority prevails. In the long run there cannot be any such thing as an unpopular system of government...The supremacy of public opinion determines not only the singular role that economics occupies in the complex of thought and knowledge. It determines the whole process of human history... great men cannot succeed in adjusting social conditions to their plans if they do not convince public opinion.

>The flowering of human society depends on two factors: the intellectual power of outstanding men to conceive sound social and economic theories, and the ability of these or other men to make these [ideologies palatable to the majority."](https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/920)
 
We should focus on our most 'viral ideas', those ideas that can both explain the most as quickly as possible and also cause enough doubt on what the current crop of clueless "experts"-apes are recommending(essentially more regulation-planning and 'Central Bank Socialism' by creating money to manage the social order). [In his essay "The Task Confronting Libertarians" Hazlitt advised us to focus](https://mises.org/library/task-confronting-libertarians) on the basics on monetary policy and inflation because it is easy to understand, teach, and immediately lets people know that it is the Central Banks that are responsible for the inflation, rising prices, and general growth of government:

>“This brings me, finally, to one more single issue on which all those libertarians who lack the time or background for specialized study can effectively concentrate. This is in demanding that the government provide an honest currency, and that it stop inflating.

>This issue has the inherent advantage that it can be made clear and simple because fundamentally it is clear and simple. All inflation is government made. All inflation is the result of increasing the quantity of money and credit; and the cure is simply to halt the increase.

>If libertarians lose on the inflation issue, they are threatened with the loss of every other issue. If libertarians could win the inflation issue, they could come close to winning everything else. If they could succeed in halting the increase in the quantity of money, it would be because they could halt the chronic deficits that force this increase. If they could halt these chronic deficits, it would be because they had halted the rapid increase in welfare spending and all the socialistic schemes that are dependent on welfare spending. If they could halt the constant increase in spending, they could halt the constant increase in government power."


Hayek's focus on how competition spreads information and superior order and how governments prevent-slow-down this process is also easy and a powerful way to get people closer to the proper understanding of how private property leads to economic freedom which then leads to competition and superior order. Concentrating on reaching famous people seems like a simple and great strategy. There is no reason why famous athletes and movie stars and other "influencers" can't understand how the world works and then quickly spread such wisdom to the fans who admire-trust them. Wealthy people have the advantage that they can voice potentially unpopular or misunderstood opinions that could cause people to fear conflicts at work-etc. Every one of us is just one or two connections away from a very famous and potentially influential person.

In his presidential runs of 2008/2012 Congressman Dr. Ron Paul, by running for office and thus placing himself where concerned citizens look for answers, became a great beacon of economic education and so much more. If we have a mini Ron Paul in every political race, likewise educating the public, overcoming the ignorance should quickly follow. 

Mises:

>"the masses follow the lead of the people we call educated. Once convince these, and the game is won."

The astute young programmers and dreamers that overwhelmingly make up the world of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies is already dominated by people who have caught up to Mises/Hayek and their so-called 'Austrian School' of economists. The creators of [Bitcoin were fervent intellectual descendent of Mises](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/origins-of-bitcoin/). The second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, was created by Vitalik Buterin who nicely sums up the ongoing intellectual revolution when he mentioned that [“I thought Austrian economics was like the world”.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=30&v=VosfxChTxVg&feature=youtu.be). Interest in Bitcoin-cryptocurrencies inadvertently achieves what Hazlitt advised above, it teaches the [basics of inflation to millions.](https://hayekian.medium.com/how-bitcoin-spreads-austrian-economics-and-thus-worldwide-intellectual-revolution-9df49929725d)

Unimaginable peace and prosperity could be just around the corner!. As the great Murray Rothbard recommends in ["The Case for Radical Idealism"](https://mises.org/library/case-radical-idealism). We should go BIG! We just have to help our fellow citizens lose their fear of economic freedom and thus economic ignorance. The bigger the tax-cut, the bigger the job losses-wages in the public sector will be, but just as quickly, the bigger the job gains-wages will be in the private sector as tax-payers now have that additional wealth to spend. All that will happen is that a public sector employee loses his public sector job and quickly finds a private sector one. Instead of getting his paycheck-wealth by coercing the taxpayer as part of a massively-inefficient government monopoly and thus providing very little in return, he now joins a much more productive private sector order-company that is growing-hiring because tax-payers are now giving them more business-money-wealth with which to hire-sustain him. All wealth that is given by government has to be taken away coercively (or sneakily via inflation) from others who in a sense gave up a part of their lives to produce it. Whenever you get something from the government you are essentially consuming another person's life/order. This is not some moralist crusade against government, we just want to understand and minimize such inefficient coercion which when properly understood, most of us will find it immoral. The better people understand economics the more they will be willing to go along with these transitions to skyrocketing prosperity, even those who currently have relatively well-paid government jobs. Again, economic education is the key.

Decentralization, or just having one massive peaceful and well publicized tax rebellion could do it or provide yet another spark of education from which something greater can arise. If just 70%-80% of all citizens in one small city in the country politely explained their economic arguments for not paying income taxes, or secede and become a new small country like Lichtenstein, and do so in a manner that does not interfere with the private property of people, it could become an immense beacon of publicity and education. It is one thing for some religious people to hunker down in some compound and say God told them it was immoral to pay taxes and Bill Gates is an agent of the Devil, so the economically ignorant public, would see them as nuts and want them to be made an example of and taken to jail. But if the "rebels" use this to properly educate the public about sound economic policy, things should be different. 

Let us further discuss some simple ways to quickly get mankind on a quick path to unimaginable prosperity. The quicker we can help people overcome their fear of freedom and clearly see the rapid prosperity we can have the better.

Just a slight increase in prosperity and the spread of freedom will quickly alleviate poverty, ignorance, and the extremist ideologies. This will greatly help soothe the chaos in the Middle East. Extremist religious views, those of Israeli settlers as well as the Islamic kind will quickly see their ideologies lose their appeal and lead to the melting away of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 



### The RFK Jr. 2024 Campaign. Speeches and Comments.

RFK Jr's inaugural speech on 4/19/2023 displayed a great understanding of much of what is needed to save civilization. Regarding a basic understanding of how government money creation to finance stupidity leads to higher prices he mentions:

>"...between 1900 and 2008 we've been printed a trillion dollars....between 2008 and today we've printed 10 trillion....to pay for bailouts and lockdowns...inflation is a tax on the poor...basic foodstuffs like chicken Dairy and milk it's gone up 78 percent"

RFK Jr. is a firm believer in real capitalism, unaided or corrupted by government:

>"free market capitalism worked perfectly for them"..."General Electric just had better lobbyists so it was able to escape the discipline of the free market"

In another discussion he mentions:

>"I believe in free market capitalism because i believe that the marketplace promotes efficiency...A free market would urge us to properly value our natural resources...In a true free market you cant make yourself rich without making your neighbors rich and without enriching your community...

Little needs to be said regarding RFK Jr's understanding and courage regarding the medical 'Priesthood of Scientism' given his excellent books like 'The Real Anthony Fauci' and work with https://childrenshealthdefense.org/.


Just as importantly RFK Jr. is significantly aware of how militarism, especially by the so-called Neocons, is largely responsible for the destruction of American prosperity and unimaginable suffering and chaos in the Middle East and more. We quote at length:


>"President Biden said that one of our objectives at least is regime change of Vladimir Putin and this is the same strategy that did not work for well for us in Iraq. And it's many of the same people who were around, the neocons, who are around President Biden who have been talking about that for a long time and have been engaged in geopolitical imaginations in the Ukraine since 2014.... President Biden's Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin validated President Biden's statement by saying that our objective in the Ukraine is to exhaust and degrade the Russian army so they're incapable of having battles anywhere else in the world....Many of the steps that we've taken in the Ukraine have seemed to indicate that our interest is in prolonging the war rather than shortening it so if those are our objectives to have regime change and exhaust the Russians that is completely antithetical to a humanitarian mission."

>"....my uncle came into office two months later, he was fighting his intelligence apparatus in his military because they wanted to invade[Cuba]... I mean they wanted to do the Bay of Pigs, he was totally against it and he let them roll over him ....and he said 'I want to take the CIA and shatter it into a thousand pieces and Scatter it to the winds' ....George W bush had the same problem... George W bush says the worst mistake he made as president was listening to CIA director George tannett tell him it was a slam dunk that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and so the neocons and CIA got to go into Iraq, and throw out, and do regime change... We've spent eight trillion dollars and what do we get for that eight trillion? Nothing! Worse than nothing! Iraq is now much worse off than it was when we went in there...We killed more Iraqis than Saddam Hussein ever did. We may have killed a million Iraqis, and nobody knows the number....It is an incoherent country today... Shia death squads are fighting with Sunni death squads in the street. The government is corrupt, the police are corrupt, we created Isis, we drove 2 million refugees up into Europe and destabilized democracy for a generation in Europe, they caused Brexit. This is the cost of the Iraq War. Eight trillion dollars there, 16 trillion for the lockdowns, 24 trillion. Nothing to show except a devastated middle class in the United States of America, and we need to put an end in that."


Ouch, a moose is biting us.
