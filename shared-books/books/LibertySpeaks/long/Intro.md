## Preface.

Welcome to the 'The Liberty Speaks Book'! This book-project is a collaborative Open Source project put together by the increasing number of people who feel like they have had the immense fortune of having stumbled upon the proper understanding of economic freedom (and thus how the world works) as provided by the legendary economists known as 'The Austrian School of Economics'. 

Just like the Linux operating system can be continuously improved and propagated by many people, we likewise hope that the Open Source nature of this project motivates others to both improve it and speak on its behalf thus hopefully maximizing its reach.

## Introduction.

Imagine you had a time machine and went back in time about 300 years to Salem, Massachusetts during the famed Salem witch trials where 19 women were hanged for witchcraft, and told people that the world could function much better if there was no slavery, that women should have the same rights and freedoms as men, that homosexuality should not be criminalized and seen as part of homo sapiens, and that six million years ago we had a common ancestor with chimpanzees (we’ll assume they know what chimps are). People would see you as some devilish monstrosity spreading heretical ideas and quickly “conspire” to kill you. Would this mean that the people of the time were somehow dumb or malicious? Or members of some “vast conspiracy” of “bad guys” or “special interests” intent on taking away your freedoms? Of course not. The people would be fellow homo sapiens acting based on the prevailing myths and incentive structures of the times. If by our modern standards pretty much everything about how people saw the world 300 years ago could be understood as myths, in other words, as “widely held but false beliefs or ideas”, why should we not be open to the idea that we too are likewise immersed in mythology?

Since myths are ideas, how do we discover the best ideas, determine their validity, usefulness and spread them? How do we discover the best information with which to guide our actions and order mankind?

Among numerous great free-market economists of the ‘Austrian School’, 1974 Nobel Laureate F.A. Hayek(Mick Jagger’s favorite economist), in some of his seminal writings like ‘The Use of Knowledge in Society’ and the aptly titled ‘Competition as a discovery procedure’ helped us realize that the economic competition which emerges from people’s freedom to choose among competing alternatives or ideas is how we motivate the discovery and spread of superior information and subsequent order throughout society. This process of ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ inadvertently turns mankind into a global supercomputer as entrepreneurs via the companies they create are motivated to innovate and have to copy and thus spread each other’s innovations due to billions of minds freely trading their life-sustaining wealth for what they calculate to be best.

Coercion, whether it is by the patriarchy, slave-master, Church, and ultimately government, is not only a burden to those being coerced, but also destroys this wonderful mechanism of ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ which is what has discovered and spread the superior information which replaced erroneous mythology and continuously reordered mankind into increasingly more technologically advanced, productive, and prosperous states. This helps us understand how as the coercive and thus competition-immune-monopolistic decision-making power of the Catholic Church was reduced and individual freedom increased in Europe so did emerging ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ and resulting technological advancements thus taking Western civilization to prominence, but as the social order got mind-bogglingly complex in the late 1800s and Socialist-competition-immune-Central-Planning mythology arose, freedom and emerging ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ was destroyed leading to immense suffering and technological stagnation in Communist countries like the former Soviet Union and pre-Capitalist China.


The book can be seen as divided into two sections. The first teaches economics and more or less how the world works by summarizing some of the wisdom of the 'Austrian School of Economics', and in the second the second,
armed with the wisdom of 'The Austrian School' it will be easy to see how mankind is as lost in mythology as we were over 300 years ago, and how the competition-immune-monopolistic-decision-making power of governments inadvertently spreads mythology and tyranny in areas where there is complexity like the economy ('central planning'-related myths), biochemistry (vaccinations, 'germ theory', HIV->DEATH, virology) and history. We will also briefly discuss potential concrete solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and much that is related like the history and evolution of Jew-Gentile conflicts, which from our perspective must be broken down to economic ignorance and misunderstandings for which no one is to blame, free of misguided attacks or conspiratorial thinking. 



Our book and 'Liberty Speaks' organization also has a 'Misesian Ethos'. The great economist Ludwig von Mises wrote towards the end of his monumental treatise "Human Action" [(free PDF)](https://cdn.mises.org/Human%20Action_3.pdf) [(Amazon.com)](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Action-Ludwig-von-Mises/dp/1610161459/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=human+action&qid=1589443352&sr=8-1)

>"Economics must not be relegated to classrooms and statistical offices and must not be left to esoteric circles. It is the philosophy of human life and action and concerns everybody and everything. It is the pith of civilization and of man's human existence…All present-day political issues concern problems commonly called economic. All arguments advanced in contemporary discussion of social and public affairs deal with fundamental matters of…economics. Everybody's mind is preoccupied with economic doctrines…Everybody thinks of economics whether he is aware of it or not. In joining a political party and in casting his ballot, the citizen implicitly takes a stand upon essential economic theories…As conditions are today, nothing can be more important to every intelligent man than economics. His own fate and that of his progeny is at stake…all reasonable men are called upon to familiarize themselves with the teachings of economics. This is, in our age, the primary civic duty. Whether we like it or not, it is a fact that economics cannot remain an esoteric branch of knowledge accessible only to small groups of scholars and specialists. Economics deals with society's fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every [citizen."](https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/932)

We are Misesians to the core. Since economic ignorance is the root of our socioeconomic problems, we feel it is our "civic duty" to help fellow citizens overcome such ignorance. Mises also writes:

>"Liberalism is rationalistic. It maintains that it is possible to convince the immense majority that peaceful cooperation within the framework of society better serves their rightly understood interests than mutual battling and social disintegration. It has full confidence in man’s reason. It may be that this optimism is unfounded and that the liberals have erred. But then there is no hope left for mankind’s future."

In other words, we have to believe that we can educate "the immense majority" even if it proves to be futile, otherwise "there is no hope left for mankind's future".

If we are to quickly save mankind and reach the prosperity we are truly capable of, those of us who've had the miraculous fortune of stumbling upon Mises and fellow 'Austrian School'-thinkers must succeed at spreading their ideas before it is too late. We must find, join, and grow the people who are thoroughly convinced that such quick prosperity can be achieved and thus become beacons of hope and economic education. We must join Mises in the trenches and go over the parapet in his "intellectual battle" against the economic ignorance that threatens civilization.

Mises: 

>"Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders; no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction. Therefore, everyone, in his own interests, must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle. None can stand aside with unconcern; the interests of everyone hang on the result. Whether he chooses or not, every man is drawn into the great historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch has plunged us."
