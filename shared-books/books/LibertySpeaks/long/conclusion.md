## Concluding remarks.


If one looks at homo sapiens during the last 100,000 years it is easy to see that civilization has been a sort of cultural mutation, an anomaly (although one that was likely bound to happen), and due to our ignorance and tribalism, via world wars and central planning, we are constantly reverting to our intuitive barbarism. 


When one looks at the [biographies of fellow freemarketeers](https://cdn.mises.org/I%20Chose%20Liberty%20Autobiographies%20of%20Contemporary%20Libertarians_2.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3FQCtUReWBaMgiZGCdTGeN4sjT6eaz9Tqq0Ak81ueW5BDK8yggXb4yLUc) it is easy to notice how prior to stumbling upon the proper understanding of economics most were essentially "wild" humans, Socialists-Communists to various degrees. This just makes sense, our nature is that of the 'Law of the Jungle', how freedom leads to order instead of chaos is definitely not 'in our genes'. Jealousy, vilification, tribalism... It all seems so obvious when we stand on Mises-Hayek's shoulders. Supposedly the Dodo bird quickly went extinct because it had not evolved to recognize humans as potential dangers, we similarly just line up for central planning and self-destroy over and over and over and over. 

Most of us mistakenly believe that the best thing we could do for ourselves is to work hard, be productive, etc. Sounds reasonable right? Yes and no, although those things are important, perhaps it is even more important to join Mises in his "intellectual battle". If mankind proves to be an evolutionary dead end in the near future as certainly looks to be the case, it will not be because of the "evil" or clueless politicians and masses. It will be because those who have had the fortune of stumbling upon these and like-minded men's ideas failed to educate fellow citizens. Henry Hazlitt had the right ethos, on his 70th birthday, November 29th, 1964. He gave a wonderful speech in front of many of his friends including the great Ludwig von Mises, from which we briefly quote:

>"We Haven't Been Good Enough

>I am going to give what is no doubt a terribly oversimplified answer to that question. In the first place, we are almost hopelessly outnumbered. Our voices are simply drowned out in the general tumult and clamor. But there is another reason. And this is hard to say, above all to an audience of this sort, which contains some of the most brilliant writers and minds in the fields of economics, of jurisprudence, of politics, not only of this age but of any age. But the hard thing must be said that, collectively, we just haven't been good enough. We haven't convinced the majority. Is this because the majority just won't listen to reason? I am enough of an optimist, and I have enough faith in human nature, to believe that people will listen to reason if they are convinced that it is reason. Somewhere, there must be some missing argument, something that we haven't seen clearly enough, or said clearly enough, or, perhaps, just not said often enough.
>A minority is in a very awkward position. The individuals in it can't afford to be just as good as the individuals in the majority. If they hope to convert the majority they have to be much better; and the smaller the minority, the better they have to be. They have to think better. They have to know more. They have to write better. They have to have better controversial manners. Above all, they have to have far more courage. And they have to be [infinitely patient."](https://mises.org/library/hazlitts-reflections-70)

If civilization survives, it will be because the general public finally understands freedom, and when this occurs, people will look back and see who the real heroes and tireless workers were, and Hazlitt will be recognized as a GOAT. His classic book, the most widely read introduction to economics, ["Economics in One Lesson"](https://fee.org/media/14946/economicsinonelesson.pdf) might have also been one of those civilization-saving efforts. 

Mankind's problems are obviously the result of the economic ignorance of the public which then, via democracy, reflects itself in the disastrous competition-less central planning bureaucracies the well-intentioned masses always fall for. It is their ignorance, that of your neighbor, former self, family members, etc. that is the root of the problems, not whatever slightly smarter ape they vote for and the inevitable corruption that emerges in the competition-immune-self-serving bureaucracies.

Mises:

>"... in the field of social organization and economic policies. Here the best theories are useless if not supported by public opinion. They cannot work if not accepted by a majority of the people. Whatever the system of government may be, there cannot be any question of ruling a nation lastingly on the ground of doctrines at variance with public opinion. In the end the philosophy of the majority prevails. In the long run there cannot be any such thing as an unpopular system of government...The supremacy of public opinion determines not only the singular role that economics occupies in the complex of thought and knowledge. It determines the whole process of human history... great men cannot succeed in adjusting social conditions to their plans if they do not convince public opinion.

>The flowering of human society depends on two factors: the intellectual power of outstanding men to conceive sound social and economic theories, and the ability of these or other men to make these [ideologies palatable to the majority."](https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/920)

Since it is a "battle of ideas" against economic ignorance for which nobody is really "to blame", we should try to keep our cool by not turning a problem of economic ignorance into a moral one which as Mises told us only leads to "irreconcilable conflict". Hayek also explains:

>"When I stressed that is genuine intellectual error that we have to fight, what I meant to bring out is that we ought to remain aware that our opponents are often high-minded idealists whose harmful teachings are inspired by very noble ideals. It seems to me that the worst mistake a fighter for our ideals can make is to ascribe to our opponents dishonest or immoral aims. I know it is sometimes difficult not to be irritated into a feeling that most of them are a bunch of irresponsible demagogues who ought to know better... if we have not yet convinced them, the reason must be that our arguments are not yet quite good enough, that we have not yet made explicit some of the foundations on which our conclusions rest. Our chief task therefore must still be to improve the argument on which our case for [a free society rests."](https://fee.org/resources/fa-hayek-on-fee-and-leonard-read/)

Thus it is vitally important that we do not vilify or see the clueless bureaucrats-Faucis-etc. as malicious. Being too critical or harsh on the bureaucrats will make it harder for them to be open to the right ideas, or downright dangerous. 

Or maybe not, the world is incredibly complex, perhaps some righteous indignation and vilification of the clueless bureaucrats that are destroying civilization is a crucial part of the winning strategy to get people to act in a way that prevents the continuing socioeconomic collapse. The truth is that our human nature coupled with competition-less bureaucracies does lead to some very bad apples across our governments at the national, state, and city levels, and some or much moral indignation to various degrees might be ideal-vital. Perhaps criticizing and attempting to pacify this moral indignation proves to be a great error. Who knows, but we should always be aware that it is the economic ignorance and tribalism of ourselves-neighbors that ultimately underpins most of our big-government-central-planning-coercive disasters.

We should focus on our most 'viral ideas', those ideas that can both explain the most as quickly as possible and also cause enough doubt on what the current crop of clueless "experts"-apes are recommending(essentially more regulation-planning and 'Central Bank Socialism' by creating money to manage the social order). [In his essay "The Task Confronting Libertarians" Hazlitt advised us to focus](https://mises.org/library/task-confronting-libertarians) on the basics on monetary policy and inflation because it is easy to understand, teach, and immediately lets people know that it is the Central Banks that are responsible for the inflation, rising prices, and general growth of government:

>“This brings me, finally, to one more single issue on which all those libertarians who lack the time or background for specialized study can effectively concentrate. This is in demanding that the government provide an honest currency, and that it stop inflating.

>This issue has the inherent advantage that it can be made clear and simple because fundamentally it is clear and simple. All inflation is government made. All inflation is the result of increasing the quantity of money and credit; and the cure is simply to halt the increase.

>If libertarians lose on the inflation issue, they are threatened with the loss of every other issue. If libertarians could win the inflation issue, they could come close to winning everything else. If they could succeed in halting the increase in the quantity of money, it would be because they could halt the chronic deficits that force this increase. If they could halt these chronic deficits, it would be because they had halted the rapid increase in welfare spending and all the socialistic schemes that are dependent on welfare spending. If they could halt the constant increase in spending, they could halt the constant increase in government power."


Hayek's focus on how competition spreads information and superior order and how governments prevent-slow-down this process is also easy and a powerful way to get people closer to the proper understanding of how private property leads to economic freedom which then leads to competition and superior order. Concentrating on reaching famous people seems like a simple and great strategy. There is no reason why famous athletes and movie stars and other "influencers" can't understand how the world works and then quickly spread such wisdom to the fans who admire-trust them. Wealthy people have the advantage that they can voice potentially unpopular or misunderstood opinions that could cause people to fear conflicts at work-etc. Every one of us is just one or two connections away from a very famous and potentially influential person.

In his presidential runs of 2008/2012 Congressman Dr. Ron Paul, by running for office and thus placing himself where concerned citizens look for answers, became a great beacon of economic education and so much more. If we have a mini Ron Paul in every political race, likewise educating the public, overcoming the ignorance should quickly follow. 

The astute young programmers and dreamers that overwhelmingly make up the world of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies is already dominated by people who have caught up to Mises/Hayek and their so-called 'Austrian School' of economists. The creators of [Bitcoin were fervent intellectual descendent of Mises](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/origins-of-bitcoin/). The second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, was created by Vitalik Buterin who nicely sums up the ongoing intellectual revolution when he mentioned that [“I thought Austrian economics was like the world”.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=30&v=VosfxChTxVg&feature=youtu.be). Interest in Bitcoin-cryptocurrencies inadvertently achieves what Hazlitt advised above, it teaches the [basics of inflation to millions.](https://hayekian.medium.com/how-bitcoin-spreads-austrian-economics-and-thus-worldwide-intellectual-revolution-9df49929725d)

Unimaginable peace and prosperity could be just around the corner!. As the great Murray Rothbard recommends in ["The Case for Radical Idealism"](https://mises.org/library/case-radical-idealism). We should go BIG! We just have to help our fellow citizens lose their fear of economic freedom and thus economic ignorance. The bigger the tax-cut, the bigger the job losses-wages in the public sector will be, but just as quickly, the bigger the job gains-wages will be in the private sector as tax-payers now have that additional wealth to spend. All that will happen is that a public sector employee loses his public sector job and quickly finds a private sector one. Instead of getting his paycheck-wealth by coercing the taxpayer as part of a massively-inefficient government monopoly and thus providing very little in return, he now joins a much more productive private sector order-company that is growing-hiring because tax-payers are now giving them more business-money-wealth with which to hire-sustain him. All wealth that is given by government has to be taken away coercively (or sneakily via inflation) from others who in a sense gave up a part of their lives to produce it. Whenever you get something from the government you are essentially consuming another person's life/order. This is not some moralist crusade against government, we just want to understand and minimize such inefficient coercion which when properly understood, most of us will find it immoral. The better people understand economics the more they will be willing to go along with these transitions to skyrocketing prosperity, even those who currently have relatively well-paid government jobs. Again, economic education is the key.

Decentralization, or just having one massive peaceful and well publicized tax rebellion could do it or provide yet another spark of education from which something greater can arise. If just 70%-80% of all citizens in one small city in the country politely explained their economic arguments for not paying income taxes, or secede and become a new small country like Lichtenstein, and do so in a manner that does not interfere with the private property of people, it could become an immense beacon of publicity and education. It is one thing for some religious people to hunker down in some compound and say God told them it was immoral to pay taxes and Bill Gates is an agent of the Devil, so the economically ignorant masses, would see them as nuts and want them to be made an example of and taken to jail. But if the "rebels" use this to properly educate the masses, things should be different. 

Let us further discuss some simple ways to quickly get mankind on a path to unimaginable prosperity. The quicker we can help people overcome their fear of freedom and clearly see the rapid prosperity we can have the better. 

Abolish minimum wage laws and other restrictions on labor like minimum age requirements and obviously all the Coromunism related restrictions. This would allow everyone to work adding a tremendous boost to the economy and the very morals of people. Coromunism is over! This would greatly reduce crime since former “criminals” will now be able to find employment. It is true that some of their first jobs might not pay much initially, but with a few months of experience and the reputation that also comes from this, their productivity would rise and thus would their income. The ability of children and teens to work will greatly reduce whatever little poverty exists in the USA and help to further shape a productive character, one that not only values hard work, honesty, competition, and so on, but a character that appreciates and expects those same values from other individuals because teamwork and mutual respect is crucial for successful competition. Hard working and honest people inevitably force others to be likewise. The sooner and easier we make it for people to integrate themselves into the private sector and its attitude-shaping incentives the better. Public education should be abolished immediately as well. With places like http://www.khanacademy.org/, Wikipedia.org, and the many free educational sites and games and the ability to use video-web conferencing via programs like Skype-Zoom to talk to a knowledgeable person it should be obvious to realize that there is little need to spend thousands of dollars to learn the basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills needed to move on to more challenging concepts, and much less the need for expensive temple-or-prison-like structures we call “schools”. The war on drugs should be ended immediately and those that have been incarcerated or on parole because of it released from such bondage. At its core the drug war is simply coercion by a group of haters against others. This would turn over a million people-prisoners into wealth producers instead of wealth consumers, reunite parents with children and once again integrate people into the productive-morals-shaping private sector. The violent drug cartels that are destroying Mexico and other Latin American countries would also disappear. And also greatly help black people who are hit hardest by the drug war. 

The US military and national defense budget can be quickly reduced to 1/10th of what it currently is(or completely abolished but I won’t get into that here). All troops from overseas can come home, given a check for 2 months pay and that’s it. The government can continue to pay for the care of people who have been wounded/incapacitated. Massive de-regulation of healthcare would bring costs there to 10% of what they currently are in a matter of months. A few months later there will be no need for US military at all since the intellectual revolution will have similar demilitarizing effects all over the world. The immediate explosion in production, and how this increased in wealth ultimately goes to workers as companies compete for labor, will immediately turn the USA into the magical place it was in the 1910s where everyone had a job and was eager and looking forward to the future. This only becomes easily believable once people understand economics obviously.

The national debt should simply be repudiated period! As Murray N. Rothbard writes:

>“I propose, then, a seemingly drastic but actually far less destructive way of paying off the public debt at a single blow: out-right debt repudiation. Consider this question: why should the poor, battered citizens of Russia or Poland or the other ex-Communist countries be bound by the debts contracted by their former Communist masters? In the Communist situation, the injustice is clear: that citizens struggling for freedom and for a free-market economy should be taxed to pay for debts contracted by the monstrous former ruling class. But this injustice only differs by degree from "normal" public debt. For, conversely, why should the Communist government of the Soviet Union have been bound by debts contracted by the Czarist government they hated and overthrew? And why should we, struggling American citizens of today, be bound by debts created by a past ruling elite who contracted these debts at our expense?”

People who owe money to the government should just not pay it back. This will greatly help the millions of students who got fooled by the bureaucracy into needing an overpriced college “education”.

If we reach enough of an understanding of freedom and economics to begin to discuss these things in the mainstream then we have definitely reached enough of an ideological change where we can drop our borders and encourage anyone who wishes to do so to come to the US. The statue of liberty will once again be free to welcome people with her beautiful and compassionate message:

>“Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door”

Just a slight increase in prosperity and the spread of freedom will quickly alleviate poverty, ignorance, and the extremist ideologies. This will greatly help soothe the chaos in the Middle East. Extremist religious views, those of Israeli settlers as well as the Islamic kind will quickly see their ideologies lose their appeal and lead to the melting away of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ouch, a moose is biting us.
