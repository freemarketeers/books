## Preface.

Welcome to the 'The Liberty Speaks Book'! This book-project is a collaborative Open Source project put together by the increasing number of people who feel like they have had the immense fortune of having stumbled upon the proper understanding of economic freedom (and thus how the world works) as provided by the legendary economists known as 'The Austrian School of Economics'. 

The Liberty Speaks organization seeks to educate people on the vital link between liberty and its emerging socioeconomic prosperity. We are Misesians to the core. The great free-market economist of the so-called ‘Austrian School’, Ludwig von Mises, believed that economic education is the key to solving mankind’s problems. He passionately tells us:

>“all reasonable men are called upon to familiarize themselves with the teachings of economics. This is, in our age, the primary civic duty… Economics deals with society’s fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen.”

Just like the Linux operating system can be continuously improved and propagated by many people, we likewise hope that the Open Source nature of this project motivates others to both improve it and speak on its behalf thus hopefully maximizing its reach.

## Introduction.

Imagine you had a time machine and went back in time about 300 years to Salem, Massachusetts during the famed Salem witch trials where 19 women were hanged for witchcraft, and told people that the world could function much better if there was no slavery, that women should have the same rights and freedoms as men, that homosexuality should not be criminalized and seen as part of homo sapiens, and that six million years ago we had a common ancestor with chimpanzees (we’ll assume they know what chimps are). People would see you as some devilish monstrosity spreading heretical ideas and quickly “conspire” to kill you. Would this mean that the people of the time were somehow dumb or malicious? Or members of some “vast conspiracy” of “bad guys” or “special interests” intent on taking away your freedoms? Of course not. The people would be fellow homo sapiens acting based on the prevailing myths and incentive structures of the times. If by our modern standards pretty much everything about how people saw the world 300 years ago could be understood as myths, in other words, as “widely held but false beliefs or ideas”, why should we not be open to the idea that we too are likewise immersed in mythology?

Since myths are ideas, how do we discover the best ideas, determine their validity, usefulness and spread them? How do we discover the best information with which to guide our actions and order mankind?

Among numerous great free-market economists of the ‘Austrian School’, Mises' pupil and 1974 Nobel Laureate F.A. Hayek(Mick Jagger’s favorite economist), in some of his seminal writings like ‘The Use of Knowledge in Society’ and the aptly titled ‘Competition as a discovery procedure’ helped us realize that the economic competition which emerges from people’s freedom to choose among competing alternatives or ideas is how we motivate the discovery and spread of superior information and subsequent order throughout society. This process of ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ inadvertently turns mankind into a global supercomputer as entrepreneurs via the companies they create are motivated to innovate and have to copy and thus spread each other’s innovations due to billions of minds freely trading their life-sustaining wealth for what they calculate to be best.

Coercion, whether it is by the patriarchy, slave-master, Church, and ultimately government, is not only a burden to those being coerced, but also destroys this wonderful mechanism of ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ which is what has discovered and spread the superior information which replaced erroneous mythology and continuously reordered mankind into increasingly more technologically advanced, productive, and prosperous states. This helps us understand how as the coercive and thus competition-immune-monopolistic decision-making power of the Catholic Church was reduced and individual freedom increased in Europe so did emerging ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ and resulting technological advancements thus taking Western civilization to prominence, but as the social order got mind-bogglingly complex in the late 1800s and Socialist-competition-immune-Central-Planning mythology arose, freedom and emerging ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ was destroyed leading to immense suffering and technological stagnation in Communist countries like the former Soviet Union and pre-Capitalist China.


Since economic ignorance is the root of our socioeconomic problems, per Mises, we feel it is our "civic duty" to help fellow citizens overcome such ignorance. Mises also writes:

>"Liberalism is rationalistic. It maintains that it is possible to convince the immense majority that peaceful cooperation within the framework of society better serves their rightly understood interests than mutual battling and social disintegration. It has full confidence in man’s reason. It may be that this optimism is unfounded and that the liberals have erred. But then there is no hope left for mankind’s future."

In other words, we have to believe that we can educate "the immense majority" even if it proves to be futile, otherwise "there is no hope left for mankind's future".

If we are to quickly save mankind and reach the prosperity we are truly capable of, those of us who've had the miraculous fortune of stumbling upon Mises and fellow 'Austrian School'-thinkers must succeed at spreading their ideas before it is too late. We must find, join, and grow the people who are thoroughly convinced that such quick prosperity can be achieved and thus become beacons of hope and economic education. We must join Mises in the trenches and go over the parapet in his "intellectual battle" against the economic ignorance that threatens civilization.

Mises: 

>"Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders; no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction. Therefore, everyone, in his own interests, must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle. None can stand aside with unconcern; the interests of everyone hang on the result. Whether he chooses or not, every man is drawn into the great historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch has plunged us." (Mises, 1981)

This book's "Hayekian" focus on how information arises and coordinates the social order provides a framework to pack many vital economic concepts into a short book. We will explain concepts we feel everyone should understand like 1) the Mises-Hayek explanation for the impossibility of Socialism-Communism, information which could have prevented millions of people from falling for the horrendous Socialist-Communist disasters of the 20th century which still affect Cuba, North Korea, and all of us to various degrees. 2) The 'Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle' which explains how governments all over the world via misguided central bank policy create the booms and busts which plague economies leading to socioeconomic chaos and political unrest. 3) The foolishness of mainstream 'Keynesian Economics' and leading mainstream economists like 2008 Nobel Laureate in Economics Paul Krugman. 4) Founder of the 'Austrian School' Carl Menger's explanation of the evolution of money which is a VITAL concept needed to make sense of how the socioeconomic order works, has evolved, and just as importantly, why mankind remains lost in economic ignorance and resulting socioeconomic chaos. 5) How mankind's ignorance of how the socioeconomic order evolved led to Socialist-Communist mythology resulting in world-wide Communist revolutions and the vital role that Ludwig von Mises played in nearly single-handedly saving civilization. 6) Many other related insights from 'The Austrian School' economists.
