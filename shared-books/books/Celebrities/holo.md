#### The Monumental Significance and Ramifications of Holocaust Doubt-Revision-Denial

The conspiratorial misguided errors that the "antisemites" make also plays a vital role regarding the mainstream Holocaust narrative of the deliberate attempt to exterminate Jews by Nazi leadership using gas-chambers and much that emerges from it. Many 'antisemites' see various aspects of the mainstream  Holocaust narrative as some deliberate lie or plot by the all-powerful and controlling Jews to gain support for their Zionism-Israel and other self-serving purposes. 

The alarm that many Jews must feel since so many gas-chamber doubters-deniers accuse Jews of making up the Holocaust as part of some sinister plan is quite understandable, for example, gas-chamber doubter Friedrich Berg, writes the following scary absurdities in his book “Nazi Gassings” :

>“…especially the Jews with their age-old traditions of hate and mass murder and lying…were and still are the real monsters, the natural-born killers, the genocidal maniacs, aliens from another world of lies and hatred for everything that is not Jewish.”

With respect to why Americans believe the Holocaust Berg writes the following conspiratorial nonsense:

>“…the fact that so many Americans want to believe, even passionately, reveals something much darker. That passionate faith in the hoax may come from deep-rooted inferiority and racial prejudice and jealousy vis a vis the Germans—perhaps for German technical and scientific superiority and achievements, at least until the end of WW2, as compared with America. How many Americans from the president on down have any idea that the automobile, for example, was NOT an American invention but a German one? Such truths are more than they can bear. If America’s vast ignorati didn’t have the holocaust hoax to boost their self-esteem compared to the Germans, they would have to invent something else. It looks like good old racism albeit in a less obvious form—not black versus white as in the past, but another form which is politically correct especially to the Jews who are America’s real masters.”

German former lawyer and political activist Horst Mahler, who has been serving a 12 year sentence for denying the gas-chamber narrative and other statements about Jews, mentioned the following scary statements on April 19th, 2017:

>“Jews are on a divine mission to destroy humanity The Bible states this categorically. For example, … the Prophet Isiah say:

>>“The Lord is angry with all the nations” — yes, that us of course. “He will totally destroy them, he will give them over to slaughter. >>Their slain will be thrown out, their dead bodies will stink; the mountains will be soaked with their blood.”

>This is what awaits us. This is in their holy book. With these texts as evidence, they can’t say it’s pseudo-science or a conspiracy. These are things which they cannot deny. And then there are other passages where we as educated, moral human beings in the Christian sense, want to immediately wage protest Jews are authorised to sexually abuse little girls aged three years and a day. Of course, this doesn’t apply to Jewish girls, only to non-Jews. Raping non-Jews — raping us — is not only permitted, it’s practically encouraged….

>Moreover, all what is happening today — the financial crisis, theft via usury where people are bled to the max — and the world gets poorer as a result. Jews are guilty of all this.”

Who in today’s world takes religious scriptures of bygone days so seriously? Obviously Mr. Mahler and many others do. Also notice the economically ignorant attack on “usury” and the blaming of the financial crisis on Jews. Again, as with Hitler, we see the same errors rooted in economic ignorance repeating. I have read tons about the workings and history of the Federal Reserve and American financial system, and by Jewish intellectual giants like Murray N. Rothbard(who even happen to be very critical of Israeli government policy), and I have not seen any evidence of any sort of “conspiracy by Jews” for such sinister purposes. Unfortunately, since Jews and the mainstream lack the intellectual tools needed to deconstruct antisemitism into its underlying economic ignorance, we simply get the intellectual persecution-jailings of deniers-doubters and so on. With clearly misguided or "antisemitic" and potentially dangerous views like that, it is understandable how Jews and respectable people push for the incarceration of people who end up "denying" the standard Hitler-orchestrated-gassings-of-millions narrative. However, some of the most prominent critics or doubters of the standard Holocaust narrative and its maniacal mass-gassings also happen to be Jews like David Cole, and Paul Eisen. These Jews obviously do NOT see the standard narrative as some sinister Jewish-led 'conspiracy' or hold malicious views towards fellow Jews, but see it more as the evolution of a complex myth arising from extremely turbulent and chaotic times like World War Two, similar to how Germans during World War One were widely but wrongly believed to have been sinisterly chopping off the hands of Belgian babies and crucifying Canadian soldiers.  

Could the standard Holocaust narrative of a deliberate extermination of Jews primarily via 'gas chambers' really be a myth that could mislead so many people? It certainly could. Keep in mind that in just the last 200 years mankind in general has overcome two massive myths that to various degrees are still being overcome, religious control of society, as well as Socialism-Communism. In both instances large groups of bright and well intentioned people went along with the myths. Also, very importantly, both of these were myths, NOT conspiracies. In the remainder of this section we just want to achieve one thing. For the reader to understand the vital need to defend freedom of speech, and hopefully be motivated to take active steps to help overturn the horrendous Holocaust Denial laws, and rightly see revisionists-doubters, especially those who have gone to jail over it like Ernst Zundel, Germar Rudolf and others, as the heroes that they are. A truly wise and civilized people know very well that all we need is the freedom from which emerges the 'competitive knowledge discovery' that will get us as close to the truth as possible. If that has yet to be achieved, especially in this monumentally complex area, we hope that the rest below will help towards that cause. Instead of looking at the standard maniacal gas-chamber Holocaust narrative and all that grows from it as the result of some "hoax" or "lie" or deliberately "plotted" by "The Jews" for their countelss alleged purposes like to justify the need for their own country (Zionism) as the 'antisemites' see it. Or as the result of 'the oldest hatred' or 'antisemitic forces' or whatever mixture of pseudo-science, psychobabble, and mysticism many Jews understandably see leading to it. We will see it as the potential evolution of a complex myth which some cleverly refer to as Holocaustianity. 

Unlike Word War One Germans who had the freedom to question and eventually easily disprove such wild accusations, post Word War Two Germans were, and continue to be, prevented from showing evidence that can potentially alter, or revise, how the victors of the war portrayed them in the Nuremberg Trials conducted after World War Two, which is where the mass-gassing allegations were originally "proven". This will sound shocking to those who read about it for the first time, but in the trials the Russians also provided evidence, which can be easily verified in the official Trial docs per links below, that the evil Nazis killed people via:

1. Steam chamber for the extermination of human beings [(IMT XXXII 153-158, III 567)](http://www.cwporter.com/pg2.htm); 
2. Electrical chamber for the extermination of human beings [(IMT VII 576-577, XII 369)](http://www.cwporter.com/pg8.htm); 
3. German atomic bomb for the extermination of Auschwitz inmates[(IMT XVI 529)](http://www.cwporter.com/pg11.htm); 
4. Tree used as murder weapon by Wehrmacht [(IMT VII 582)](http://www.cwporter.com/pg13.htm); 
5. Portable oven used for the extermination of Russian prisoners of war[(IMT VII 586)](http://www.cwporter.com/pg14.htm); 
6. Pedal-driven brain bashing machine used for the extermination of Russian prisoners of war [(IMT VII 376-377)](http://www.cwporter.com/pg15.htm); 
7. Bone-grinding machine [(IMT VII 439, 549-550, 446, 593)](http://www.cwporter.com/pg20.htm); 
8. Spanking machine [(IMT VI 213)](http://www.cwporter.com/pg26.htm); 

The Americans also provided “evidence” that proved deaths by ‘gas chamber’ in the Dachau concentration camp which all mainstream Holocaust historians today accept as having been fabricated. As the famed Nazi-Hunter Simon Wiesenthal once admitted “It is true that there were no extermination camps on German soil.”. At the beginning the 'gas chamber' claims included Dachau, but since that camp was NOT behind the Iron Curtain in the Soviet Union and could easily be examined and verified that no such gassings took place, this part of the *evolving* narrative was eventually dropped. If all of the "evidence" provided above by the Russians, everyone today knows were fabrications by the understandably vengeful and lying Stalinist-Communist government, why should it be a criminal act to doubt or question other claims? The head of the Russian legal team was Andrey Vyshinsky, the prosecutor of Stalin's “Moscow Show Trials” during Stalin's “The Great Terror-Purge” which lasted from 1936-8 and led to the executions of 700,000 to 1.2 million people. Today everyone knows the "Show Tirals" were full of lies and pure tyranny. Here is a great example of Vyshinsky’s wonderful legalese during the "Show Trials":

>“Shoot these rabid dogs! Death to this gang who hide their ferocious teeth, their eagle claws, from the people! Down with that vulture Trotsky, from whose mouth a bloody venom drips, putrefying the great ideals of Marxism! Let’s put these liars out of harm’s way, these miserable pygmies who dance around rotting carcasses! Down with these abject animals! Let's put an end once and for all to these miserable hybrids of foxes and pigs, these stinking corpses! Let's exterminate the mad dogs of capitalism, who want to tear to pieces the flower of our new Soviet nation! Let's push the bestial hatred they bear our leaders back down their own throats!” (Panne, et al., p. 750)

So it should be a criminal act to question what Vyshinsky and his team introduced as "evidence"!!!??? For real?!?!? At the beginning of World War Two, the Russians, led by one of mankind’s most brutal and lying dictators-governments, Joseph Stalin, invaded Poland and executed over 15,000 leading Poles and buried them in the Katyn forest. When the Germans then invaded the Soviet Union, thus overrunning Poland and stumbled upon this massacre, they invited the Red Cross and polish delegations to document and verify. The Poles were obviously outraged and bitterly complained to Churchill about the Soviets who are now allied with England and the USA. Churchill says “The Bolsheviks can be very cruel” and tells the Russians “We shall certainly oppose vigorously any 'investigation' by the International Red Cross or any other body in any territory under German authority. Such investigation would be a fraud and its conclusions reached by terrorism". Today everyone knows, as confirmed by Mikhail Gorbachev, that Stalin had ordered the massacre for which the Germans were blamed for at the Trials. Yet understandably Churchill kept quiet. Soviet members of the team that provided their fake Katyn “evidence” were also members of the team that gave “evidence” of 4 million deaths at Auschwitz(and extermination using ‘gas chambers’), an astronomical figure no historian accepts today. 

In the early 1990s the official Auschwitz museum downgraded the total number of deaths at the camp from 4 million to 1.5 million (1.1 million as of 2015). A reinterpretation-"revision" of history had been made. Before this reinterpretation, anyone saying that the number of deaths at Auschwitz was way overblown probably due to Soviet-Communist exaggerations would immediately be vilified for being some evil antisemite and thrown in prison in some countries, yet he would have been correct, which clearly exposes the dangers and tyranny of making it a crime to doubt a historical event, especially one created under such chaotic conditions like World War Two which brought so much suffering to so many. Again, historical narratives are information, making a particular version the only government-sanctioned version eliminates-outlaws 'competitive knowledge discovery' and thus the real search for the truth. 

Another revealing aspect of the mainstream Holocaust gas-chamber narrative is the fact that neither Churchill’s massive writings about WWII, nor top American military leader and later US president Dwight D. Eisenhower’s memoirs, nor French leader Charles De Gaulle, nor research about Hitler prepared for Stalin by his secret service, mention anything about gassings or ‘death camps’ purposed for the extermination of the Jews. How can this be!?? Well from the perspective of the ardent believers in Holocaustianity this is just further "evidence" of antisemitism. The faith in the Holocaust-extermination-by-gas-chamber myth by so many simply creates countless hypothetical scenarios which eventually become convincing enough to become parts of the mythology. 

Holocaust revisionism-doubt-denial is a world that attracts real scholarship but is also horribly tainted by its attraction of an interesting mix of characters like the stereotypical ‘Racist-Neo-Nazis’ who might erroneously believe in ‘Jewish Conspiracies to Rule the World’ or simply fall for some of the same race-based fallacies that Hitler did. Hitler’s ‘racialism’ or the importance given to race in the flourishing of civilization still makes a lot of sense to many people, especially many whites-Europeans who oppose immigration to Europe and to the U.S. by non-whites. Some of these people are often times associated with ‘extreme-right’ political parties that don’t represent mainstream 21st century Western thought which is far more inclusive of peoples from all over the world. There are also very religious Christians who see Jews as somehow religiously misguided or devilish with the same sort of mindset that might have existed in medieval Europe. Since these people are more likely to be critical of Jews it makes sense that they are more likely to question the ‘official holocaust’ narrative or deny it all together. At the same time, since these ‘extreme-right-wingers’ are viewed with suspicion by the mainstream, the mainstream dismisses their questioning of the official Holocaust narrative of ‘extermination by gas chamber’ as having more to do with their criticism of Jews or alleged “anti-Semitism” than with real historical research. Which brings me to the wonderful expression of ‘throwing out the baby with the bathwater’. Just because people who hold certain views that one might find erroneous or whacky and might have an incentive to reject the standard Holocaust narrative of ‘6 million Jewish deaths with many due to gas chambers’, it does not necessarily mean that there aren’t important truths to their claims, or the people who research and publicize such claims. If anything, if the Revisionist-doubter narrative contains important truths, it makes it easier for people in the mainstream to ignore some of their claims which might ultimately be true. In other words, if there are important truths preached by the doubters, they get thrown out with the bathwater because of the surrounding racism and anti-Semitism that some radiate. Take for example Dr. Arthur R. Butz who is one of the most important doubters-deniers and the author of “The Hoax of the Twentieth Century: The Case Against the Presumed Extermination of European Jewry”. (HORRIBLE TITLE IMHO) Dr. Butz has a master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from arguably the world’s most prestigious technical university, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and a doctorate from the University of Minnesota. There are many highly intelligent and accredited, non-religious, non-Racist-Nazi-Jew-Hating people out there (including many Jews!) whose mind and reason and 'competitive knowledge discovery' led them to the conclusion that the standard Holocaust narrative has been greatly exaggerated and inadvertently become a sort of religioun, thus Holocaustianity. 

Besides the bad blood over Zionism, their past wars and so on, a significant number of Islamic leaders do not believe in its entirety the commonly accepted Holocaust narrative of purposeful extermination via gas chambers. Current Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas did a PhD dissertation resulting in the publication of “The Other Side: The Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism” where among other claims he doubts the 6 million figure, as well as the existence of homicidal gas chambers based on the work of famous Holocaust revisionist and gas-chamber-doubter French academic Robert Faurisson. Like many other doubters or flat out deniers, Abbas believes that much of what we are told about the Holocaust is a sort of complex self-perpetuating myth that some Jews exaggerated to get sympathy-influence for their goals of creating their own state-country. Gamal Abdel Nasser, former president of Egypt and one of the most important leaders of the Arab world in the 20th century summed up the general attitude of Muslims with respect to the Holocaust when he mentioned the following to a German newspaper in 1964 “no person, not even the most simple one, takes seriously the lie of the six million Jews that were murdered in the Holocaust.” As of 2008 about 40% of Israeli Arabs do not accept the standard Holocaust narrative, a figure I am guessing is much higher today.  On December 26th, 2008 popular French comedian and standard-Holocaust-narrative-doubter Dieudonné M'bala M'bala gave a prize to revisionist-doubter Robert Faurisson in one of his performances. This stunt would earn Dieudonné a conviction under France’s Holocaust denial laws. Dieudonné appealed this decision based on his right to free speech to the European Court of Human Rights which on November 10th 2015 upheld the original conviction. He is constantly in trouble with various European authorities because his doubt-denial of the standard gas-chamber narrative, according to European laws, makes him some dangerous racist antisemite who incites racial hatred and violence, somehow. Dieudonné is a dark skinned man whose criticisms of Israeli government and humor have made him tremendously popular within the large Muslim French population and youth. Jean-Marie Le Pen, the former leader of France’s “Front National” political party and the father of the current party leader Marine Le Pen faced imprisonment if he did not pay a 30,000 Euro fine for mentioning that the killing of Jews via gas chambers in World War Two was only a “detail” of the war. It seems to me like for everyone who is public about their doubts there are 10,000 people who feel likewise. This can be easily seen via the many favorable reviews and “thumbs up” many Holocaust Revisionist videos have online and sharp criticism of videos showing the mainstream narrative which is leading to another interesting-dangerous side-effect. After years of pressure, Amazon.com had to remove dozens of “Revisionist”-denial titles that were very well reviewed. Germar Rudolf is perhaps the most well known and important publisher of Holocaust revisionist literature. He organizes the publication of a series know as the “Holocaust Handbooks” which contains over 30 volumes discussing everything from the chemistry related to gas chambers, to individual volumes specific to each location where mass exterminations are alleged to have taken place and more. Prior to their removal, the 33 volumes had over 160 reviews averaging over 3.8 stars, which when one removes the numerous 1 star reviews given by people who simply found the subject matter insulting and obviously had not read and properly criticized the material, the average review score would have been considerably higher.

On October 20th 2015, non-other than the Israeli Prime Minister himself, Benjamin Netanyahu, caused a media storm when he gave a speech where he said that:

>“Hitler didn’t want to exterminate the Jews at the time, he wanted to expel the Jews and Hajj Amin al-Husseini went to him and said if you expel them they’ll all come here. So what should I do with them? He asked. [Burn them, he said.”](https://www.salon.com/2015/10/24/holocaust_experts_shame_netanyahu_partner/)

Here Netanyahu was referring to a November 28th 1941 meeting between Hitler and Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini. In this statement, Netanyahu seemingly contradicts or ‘revises’ the standard Holocaust narrative in at least two spectacular ways, #1 he puts blame for the extermination idea not on the much vilified Hitler, but on the Grand Mufti, and #2 he implies that preparations for the alleged mass extermination of Jews could not have started until after the meeting. Had Netanyahu been an average citizen of Austria and distributed literature making such claims, he might have been jailed for up to 5 years. After a week of intense criticism Netanyahu further revised his position to be more in line with the standard narrative. This is just one example of how history can be revised-reinterpreted-etc. to suit the biases of particular actors.

Next I will use my own sort of intellectual journey to introduce more concepts related to the Holocaust and its impact.

Like most people I always assumed that anyone doubting the official ‘6 million deaths primarily via gassings’ story was some irrational-racist-'conspiracy-minded'-overtly-religious nut. I also had thoughts along the lines of “How come I’ve not already found information that doubts the official story? I’ve already read many publications about economics, science and history that go counter to mainstream thought. How come some of my favorite and most respected news sources or intellectuals don’t already mention this?” This began to change in 2015 while looking in the website www.ancreport.com ran by journalist-author Ryan Dawson. Ryan had a documentary titled “War by Deception” which I thought had lots of useful information making the case that Israeli intelligence probably knew of the 9-11 attacks. Although I was far from well-read in the subject matter I came away with appreciation for the research and work that went into it and its author. I quickly realized that Ryan was also a libertarian who had a good grasp of free-market economics so I began to keep an eye on him and his website more closely. Soon after while looking at the list of suggested documentaries on his site I stumbled upon one titled [“El Gran Taboo”](https://www.bitchute.com/video/UHDKv2JsdAbo/) which means ‘The Great Taboo’ in Spanish. I clicked and the narrator mentioned the following:

>“This is the story of three men. Three men who dared to challenge the most dangerous taboo in the Western world. This is the story of their struggle and the terrible consequences they faced.

>This man is Germar Rudolf, a German chemist working on his degree at the prestigious Max Planck institute. In 1994 Rudolf prepared a scientific report which questioned the story that the Jews were gassed at Auschwitz during the Holocaust. He soon found himself facing prosecution from the German authorities for the crime of denying the existence of gas chambers.”

The last two sentences startled me and brought thoughts along the lines of:

>“Are you kidding me!?!?! A holocaust denial video!?!?! This Ryan Dawson guy must be some conspiracy nut! No wonder he believes Israeli intelligence knew of the 9-11 attacks but didn't tell us! His great video almost had me convinced!, but now I will doubt him for being a looney Holocaust doubter-denier or even consider it by having this video on his site! Burn the heritic!” 

But at the same time, I could not help it be struck by the mild-mannered Germar Rudolf talking about his horrific ordeal. There seemed to be no trace of ‘Racist-Nazi’ or ‘Fanatical-Christian’ in him, and at the same time there was the shock of learning that in Germany you were a criminal for writing a scientific paper that doubts the official Holocaust story. 

Next came footage of Ernst Zündel, another shocker! At around 19 minutes and 20 seconds you see footage of a composed, mild-mannered man who has been held in solitary confinement for over a year answering questions in a deposition like:

>“Lawyer: After your arrival to the united states in May 2000, were you on any occasion ever told by anyone that you were a security threat to the United States?

>Ernst:  No I was not”

Towards the end of the film the narrator summarizes:

>“Germar Rudolf was extradited to Germany in 2005. After spending two years in prison awaiting trial, he was finally sentenced in March 2007 to serve and additional 30 months behind bars. By the time he gets out in September 2009 he will spend over 4 years in prison for writing a scientific report. He has not seen his wife or child since 2005. After spending 2 years in solitary confinement in Canada Ernst Zündel was deported to Germany where he was immediately imprisoned(audio breaks up for some reason)… trial for the crime of running a Holocaust revisionist website while living on the U.S. In February 2007 Zündel was sentenced to serve and additional 5 years in prison. By the time he gets out in 2012, he’ll have spent seven years in prison for posting revisionist articles on a website, he’ll be 73 years old.”

Unbelievable!!!!!

When the documentary introduces Ernst Zündel it refers to him as “Canada’s most celebrated Holocaust revisionist”, so quickly I looked him up and WOW! WOW! It turns out that Ernst had been involved in two highly publicized trials in the 1980s in Canada which were groundbreaking. Mr. Zündel went to Canada in 1958 as a 19 year old to avoid conscription in the German military because by this time he had certain strong pacifist beliefs. When he came to Canada he was a full believer in the standard Holocaust narrative and how his parent’s generation did so much evil. By 1958, so close to WWII, there was still strong anti-German attitudes which greatly bothered him and other Germans like Dr. Fredrick Toben who would also become a famous Revisionist-denier and also do jail-time for expressing his views. In a videotaped conversation where both men had described how they got interested in Holocaust revisionism and more, Zündel mentions:

>“When I was in Canada in 1958 there was certainly anti-German feeling and it was the time when Hollywood cranked out these black and white serials called “Rat Patrol”, “Hogan’s Heroes” and films of this nature. And I could sense the next day at the workplace when an anti-German film had been played the night before. It was palpable, you could feel the poison atmosphere…It is the reaction to that that made me search for my German roots. I became a much fiercer, prouder German as time went on”

In another interview Zundel mentions:

>“We[Germans were portrayed as] were cowards, criminals, romantic dreamers, butchers, and Colonel Klinks, the butt end of every joke.”

Dr. Toben talks about being a young boy in school in Australia:

>“I participated in the Anzac ceremony at school… because the principal would announce that on this day we should remember our dead. And I would have to remember my uncle, who lost his life on the Eastern Front. My father’s brother. So I had a reason to also stand still for a minute and reflect on his death. At that time I believed that it was an inclusive remembrance day for all soldiers but later on I realized that was not the case. The Germans were the bad ones.”

By being Germans dealing with all this vilification they had more incentive to look past the standard myths which obviously led them to see their parent’s generation not as “evil” but as people reacting to a wide set of circumstances-etc. who were also victims of massive allied propaganda like in World War One. Mr. Zündel learned about the tremendous role or influence that Jews had in the war. Unfortunately and understandably, at least to me, instead of seeing such influence as a sort of evolutionary phenomena for which no one is really to blame (as we try to portray things), like many people he would see it more as a sort of deliberate conspiracy by Jews which has its problems to say the least. Mr. Zündel went beyond understanding how or why Nazi Germany ended up acting or “reacting” like it did, he liked much of Hitler’s economic policies and like many white Europeans, especially from his generation, he was against immigration into Europe of non-whites or intermarriage between whites and non-whites and wanted to ‘preserve the race’ and that sort of thinking so he was slightly sympathetic to Hitler’s racial views. For example under the alias of Christof Friedrich he published a short book with the following sacrilegious title “The Hitler We Loved and Why” which mentioned things like:

>“We loved him because he saved us from the alien invaders who promoted the extinction of our Race, the White Race.

>We loved him because he kept our entertainment media free of the perversion of race-mixing and race suicide.”
>…"In 4 years, from 1933 to 1937, he made us virtually self-sufficient in the production of steel, aluminum, chemicals, petroleum and general industrial production.[This is a bad thing but Mr. Zündel like most people today did not really understand economics]

He quotes Hitler as having said:

>“ “Capitalism and Bolshevism are the two sides of the same international Jewish coin."

- Adolf Hitler”
 

Again, making errors by falling for erroneous Jewish conspiratorial thinking. Without the proper understanding of economics it is understandable how his mind could reach such erroneous conclusions. And similarly, as an understandable reaction Jews in general react so virulently to people like Zündel. Besides feeling insulted by the negation or downplaying of their alleged suffering during the Holocaust, they rightly don’t like to see themselves portrayed as “conspiring” to harm society at large and conspiring to create such “isms” to benefit themselves and screw the rest of the world.

Regardless of his views, he would never advocate any violence towards Jews or anyone, and looking at the history of Jewish influence is a tremendously important subject which did play a factor in both world wars and European history to monumental degrees, and is obviously a huge factor in today’s politics. This reminds me of how political correctness prevents whites from criticizing black culture for fear of being labeled “racists” leaving this domain exclusively for blacks. Similarly if you are not Jewish and you discuss a potentially negative influence of Jews in a particular role-time in history (like their overrepresentation in Socialism) you risk being labeled an anti-Semite. There is a reason why Russian Jew Yuri Slezkine wrote a fantastic book titled “The Jewish Century”, because Jews have played a tremendously important role in the 20th century. Whether at times such influence has been positive or negative it should be obvious that from a historical or evolutionary perspective no one is to ‘blame’, a concept I find antiquated. From an evolutionary perspective, a perspective that is 100% focused on evolutionary forces and those sequences of thoughts and incentives intertwined with human nature and circumstances, concepts like ‘blame’ actually do more harm than good, they focus on the individuals, instead of those ideas-forces that shape actions. Once again, our very language gets in the way of a superior understanding.

For the Zündel trial the Canadian government assembled a ‘stellar cast’ for the prosecution which includes testimony from Raul Hilberg who is like the highest priest of Holocaust history-mythology for having written the sort of “Bible” of the mainstream Holocaust narrative, a book titled “The Destruction of the European Jews”. Two other ‘star witnesses’ of the prosecution were Rudolf Vrba, one of the most famous Auschwitz survivors who wrote the Holocaust classic “Escape from Auschwitz: I Cannot Forgive”, and Arnold Friedman. Vrba is of special importance because he also created the “Vrba–Wetzler report” which was one of the documents demonstrating homicidal gas chambers which were used as evidence at the Nuremberg Trials. Amazingly, this would be the first time that ‘eyewitnesses’ would be available for cross-examination in a solid English-Common-Law type of court as provided by the Canadian legal system where lying under oath is committing the crime of perjury.  Friedman made a bit of a fool of himself by stating that he could tell the nationalities of the people being cremated by looking at the flames coming out of the crematories, and ultimately with regard to gassings he relied on what others had told him instead of firsthand experience and was of no real use to the prosecution. Vrba admitted that he had used the “license of a poet”, in other words, fiction when writing his book. Some of his testimony when being challenged by Zündel’s defense lawyer Doug Christie about making stuff up in his book goes as follows :

>“I have created the situation in an artistic way, if you allow me to count myself on account of this book as an artist or as an artistic attempt….

>This is not a document, but literature, and literature has been meant mainly for young people…

>In other words, I used my licence of a poet, it is called licensia poetarium, to put in the book only those facts and events which will enable a young person to understand the general situation.”
 
For a summary of Raul Hilberg’s testimony I quote Robert Faurisson who helped the defense:

>“The prosecution expert in the first trial was Raul Hilberg, an American professor of Jewish descent and author of the standard reference work, The Destruction of the European Jews (1961), which Paul Rassinier discussed in Le Drame des Juifs européens (The Drama of the European Jews). Hilberg began his testimony by explaining, without interruption, his theory about the extermination of the Jews. He was then cross-examined by Zündel's lawyer, Douglas Christie, who was assisted by Keltie Zubko and myself. Right from the start it was clear that Hilberg, who was the world's leading authority on the Holocaust, had never examined a single concentration camp, not even Auschwitz. He had still not examined any camp in 1985 when he announced the imminent appearance of a new edition of his main work in three volumes, revised, corrected and augmented. Although he did visit Auschwitz in 1979 for a single day as part of a ceremonial appearance, he did not bother to examine either the buildings or the archives. In his entire life he has never seen a "gas chamber," either in its original condition or in ruins. (For a historian, even ruins can tell tales). On the stand he was forced to admit that there had never been a plan, a central organization, a budget or supervision for what he called the policy of the extermination of the Jews. He also had to admit that since 1945 the Allies have never carried out an expert study of "the weapon of the crime," that is to say of a homicidal gas chamber. No autopsy report has established that even one inmate was ever killed by poison gas.

>Hilberg said that Hitler gave orders for the extermination of the Jews, and that Himmler gave an order to halt the extermination on November 25, 1944 (such detail!). But Hilberg could not produce these orders. The defense asked him if he still maintained the existence of the Hitler orders in the new edition of his book. He dared to answer yes. He thereby lied and even committed perjury. In the new edition of his work (with a preface dated September 1984), Hilberg systematically deleted any mention of an order by Hitler. (In this regard, see the review by Christopher Browning, "The Revised Hilberg," Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual, 1986, p. 294). When he was asked by the defense to explain how the Germans had been able to carry out an undertaking as enormous as the extermination of millions of Jews without any kind of plan, without any central agency, without any blueprint or budget, Hilberg replied that in the various Nazi agencies there had been "an incredible meeting of minds, a consensus mind-reading by a far-flung bureaucracy." 


Needless to say, Hilberg would not show up in Zündel’s subsequent 1988 trial and the prosecution would also not bring any more ‘eyewitnesses’ to the stand. The 1988 trial would add sensation by introducing the ‘The Leuchter Report’ by an American expert in gas chambers which included chemical analysis from Auschwitz Birkenau and Majdanek camps in Poland with Leuchter’s conclusion that such locations could not have been used to support the standard claims. There is controversy surrounding his report as well as everything related to this highly charged subject and a good place to see arguments against the claims that “Revisionists” make is http://www.nizkor.org/ . Nizkor means “We will remember” in Hebrew. According to chemist Germar Rudolf his subsequent chemical analysis further improves upon Leuchter’s work. You can look for yourself in the sites and come to your own conclusions, just make sure you are not in a civilized Western Democracy like Germany and the other 15+ countries where it is a crime to reach the wrong conclusion and publicize such views.

At the 1988 trial historian David Irving also gave testimony in support of the lack of evidence for a deliberate policy of extermination and gas chambers. David Irving too would be vilified for being a ‘racist’ and anti-Semite which automatically means you can be wrong for saying 2+2=4. For example, in a later libel trial versus Deborah Lipstadt (who did not dare make herself available for cross examination by taking the stand) he admitted “that as he wheeled his nine-month-old daughter past what he calls "half-breed" children, he would sing:

>“I'm a baby Aryan Not Jewish or sectarian. I have no plans to marry an Ape or Rastafarian.”

In an interview Irving admitted that he was basically as racist as any white male from his generation was. This candid admission, in today’s politically correct world would add to the herd mentality’s hatred of him. Once again we have to remind ourselves of ‘throwing out the baby with the bathwater’. David Irving is undoubtedly one of the most important historians of Hitler and his government. British military historian John Keegan mentioned that ‘No historian of the Second World War can afford to ignore Irving.’ Famed British critic Christopher Hitchens wrote of Irving:

>“Few contemporary scholars have his depth of knowledge, virtually none has met as many of its leading figures and nobody, surely, has unearthed more original material–a private archive known as the ‘Irving Collection,’ always generously made available to other researchers, which weighs more than half a ton… He speaks faultless German. He has, in the most recent case, been the first historian to see some 75,000 pages of diary entries by Joseph Goebbels, held in secrecy in Moscow from 1945 to 1992. His studies of the Churchill-Roosevelt relationship, of the bombing of Dresden, of the campaigns of Rommel and others, are such that you can’t say you know the subject at all unless you have read them. And, incidentally, he has never and not once described the Holocaust as a “hoax.” "

Yet even such praise can’t prevent the baby from being thrown out with the bathwater as can be seen by the claim by Professor Richard J. Evans makes when he mentions:

>“Not one of [Irving’s] books, speeches or articles, not one paragraph, not one sentence in any of them, can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject. All of them are completely worthless as history, because Irving cannot be trusted anywhere, in any of them, to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about…”

When Irving researched and wrote what he considers his most important work “Hitler’s War” he was somewhat surprised about the lack of concrete evidence for a policy of extermination, yet he wrote the book believing that the standard Holocaust narrative was true. Later he would be persuaded to completely deny the existence of gas-chambers by Zündel and Faurrison and other Holocaust revisionists. Their claim that there was no deliberate policy of extermination or gas-chambers squared well with the lack of evidence Irving noticed as he was researching his book on Hitler.

In Austria in 1989 Irving made some statements which disagreed with the standard Holocaust narrative so the Austrian government issued a warrant for his arrest. About 16 years later in November 11th 2005 they caught him and he pled guilty to the crime-charge of "trivialising, grossly playing down and denying the Holocaust". Irving said that he had changed his views and only served about a year of his 3 years sentence. I don’t know what his views on the existence of homicidal gas chambers is at the moment but Irving’s change of views reminds me of an argument that revisionists make to help explain why some people have admitted in court the existence of gassings. Thanks to frauds like Rudolf Höss’ tortured confessions and more, once it became legally impossible to argue against gassings, defendants would see no alternative but to admit that they did in fact exist but somehow they were just ‘following orders’ or were not involved in their operation, or whatever else they could come up with to save their skins. This is the same reason why many in the past confessed to witch-craft and all kinds of mythical crimes we know they didn't commit. Once the legal system makes it disavantageous to tell the truth and lie, then obviously people will do so. Which then inadvertently helps the myths, exagerations, etc. keep growing in a self-reinforcing chain reaction. This again shows how one gigantic miscarriage of justice, making it a crime to dispute highly controversial history, can lead to another complicated web of lies-exaggerations, which can then form the basis for the continued strengthening of myths.

So, the bottom line is that these ‘Zündel Trials’ shocked the world and brought many eyes and doubts into a previously unquestionable subject. The transcripts of the trials also provide a wealth of information. Find [“The Great Holocaust Trial 1985”](https://www.bitchute.com/video/8CLp5xMQCIlG/) for a one hour overview of his trial and [“Ernst Zündel - Setting the Record Straight”](https://www.bitchute.com/video/vejA67DM4SfH/) for a more involved 2 hour documentary.

When Ernst Zündel was extradited to Germany to face trial there in 2006 he was defended by Sylvia Stolz who believes that the standard Holocaust story is the result of a Jewish conspiracy and she too would go to jail for saying in the trial that the standard Holocaust story was “the biggest lie in world history”. In February 2015 she would go to jail again for having denied the standard Holocaust narrative in a speech given in 2012 whose theme was, guess…, the lack of freedom of expression in Germany! MIND-FUCKING-BLOWING! 

Amazed by the revelations in Zündel’s trials, a young atheist Jew by the name of David Cole decided to look into the matter himself. He researched revisionist literature and went to Auschwitz and you can find [‘David Cole in Auschwitz’](https://www.bitchute.com/video/vAFKVGuW0QL1/) and see his documentary. Among many important arguments against the standard Holocaust story he also interviews Dr. Piper who was a top Auschwitz museum administrator who admitted that the gas chamber they were showing the public as authentic was in fact a post-war reconstruction and not the real thing.

Yet another interesting and somewhat expected aspect of the Holocaust Revisionist world which in this case both Ernst and David Cole share, is their persecution by Jewish organizations like the Jewish Defense League (JDL, founded by Rabbi Kahana) which set fire to Zündel’s home and on multiple occasions assaulted and savagely beat David Cole and even had a $25,000 bounty on his head which ultimately motivated Cole to change names and leave the Holocaust Revisionist world altogether for a while. Francois Duprat was killed in a car bomb which also left his wife without legs. French Professor Robert Faurisson has been repeatedly assaulted and once almost fatally. Germar Rudolf writes about Faurisson’s beating:

>“Even as he lay on the ground, they kicked him repeatedly in the face and chest. “His jaw and face was smashed,” reported a fireman who came to Faurisson’s rescue. Doctors spent over four hours operating on him. One group named “Sons of Jewish Memory” claimed responsibility for this attack. In a statement by this group it said: “Professor Faurisson is the first but not the last. May the Holocaust deniers tremble.” (Rudolf, p. 13102)

The Institute for Historical Review, which for a while dared to publish Revisionist literature also had one of its locations set on fire by Jewish extremists.  

Since I just mentioned the Institute for Historical Review I want to recommend that the reader watch the debate between the Institute’s Director Mark Weber and Michael Shermer.

In his book titled “Confessions of a Holocaust Revisionist” Bradley R. Smith, who founded www.codoh.com (Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust), described being hounded by JDL leader Irv Rubin, who had orchestrated the beatings of David Cole and more. Irv would call Bradley and chillingly suggest Bradley take him home and introduce him to his family, and once told Bradley:

>“I guarantee you that my dog could eat a Nazi like you without much difficulty. You’re a big man from what I hear, Bradley, so he might not be able to finish you off in one sitting, but he could do the job in two at the outside. Would you like to meet my dog, Bradley? I’d like to introduce you to him. I really would. I think it would be good for your education.” (Smith B. R., p. 627)

Mr. Bradley is a mild-mannered libertarian who could not be further from the stereotypical “Nazi”, but obviously to the ignorant zombie-like herd so beautifully represented by the likes of Rubin, he would be an evil Nazi. Rubin would die in jail of a mysterious suicide-murder while awaiting trial for alleged bomb attacks against the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California, and on the office of U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, who is of Lebanese and Czech decent. French comedian Dieudonné M'bala M'bala whom I mentioned in introductory chapter has also been attacked by JDL-like groups.

Now! VERY IMPORTANT! Violence towards dissenters like Holocaust revisionists must be properly understood as a pattern that applies to all *potential myths* or controversial subjects and should NOT be seen as 'conspiracies'. Here is what we mean. Most Jews and average people who believe the standard narrative will see Holocaust revisionists-doubters-deniers in various ways but will not go far enough as to want to harm them. But it just makes sense how statistically some will, leading to the emergence of these groups. The same thing can be said about the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris where two Muslims gunned down 12 journalists for publishing material offensive to many Muslims. This is not proof of a conspiracy by Muslims from say Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, or Jews via Mossad from Jerusalem, to sinisterly "silence" people for some grand sinister purpose. This is just pure probability and statistics. The same happens with violence towards anti-vaccination activists who are mistakenly seen by pro-vaccine people as some negligent or malicious people whose views are leading to the deaths of many. Unfortunately naive thinkers will then see such coordinated violence as proof of a 'conspiracy' by the evil plotting "Jews" or "Big Pharma" which then understandably leads the mainstream to increase the intellectual persecution. These naive thinkers, who tend to also be some of the more vicious antisemites, can then be pretty dangerous themselves and label people who refuse to buy into their 'conspiracy theories' as sympathising with "The Jews", too cowardly to take on "them" or "Big Pharma". Again, we must stay away from misguided 'conspiratorial thinking' and focus on how the ideas, and ultimately economic fallacies leading to coercion, move through minds and unite various groups of fellow homo sappiens, creating more negligent and polarized 'echo chambers' on each side.

As I am doing in this section, in his book Bradley described the shock of following his intellectual curiosity and courage as his reason inevitably lead him towards Holocaust Revisionism-doubt. An important influence on him was Dr. Arthur R. Butz’s aforementioned book. Bradley too was struck by Butz’s credentials being a top rate MIT scientist who wrote in a very confident tone. Bradley mentions:

>“I was struck by the self-confident and dispassionate tone of his voice. This Butz, I thought, he’s not real wishy-washy. He doesn’t shilly-shally around a lot.” (Smith B. R., p. 688)

I can relate, when you see videos of [Butz](https://www.bitchute.com/video/Dn73cf1rkS1C/) online [he](https://www.bitchute.com/video/wSMBZQgBvXn0/) looks like a young Mike Tyson in a pre-fight stare-down fully confident that his punches-research is going to crush his opponent. Bradley would search in vain for someone who had actually refuted Butz’s research and understandably came to dislike mainstream historians for their intellectual cowardice. He writes in his book “Confessions of a Holocaust Revisionist”:

>“It looks to me like Hilberg and Butz have a few things to talk over. Hilberg published his book in 1961. Now Butz has replied to it. The ball is in Hilberg’s court but he doesn’t want to play. Why not? Nobody else has responded to Butz either. Why not? Butz has laid his cards on the table. He has offered himself up to the historians and intellectuals of the age and not one has been willing to do the decent thing. Hilberg is quoted everywhere while Butz is suppressed everywhere. I don’t like it. I’m on Butz’s side against Hilberg. When Hilberg responds to Butz openly and fairly, I’ll be on Hilberg’s side too. As long as Hilberg cooperates in suppressing Butz by evading him, I’ll be with Butz.” (Smith B. R., p. 1162)

[Bishop Richard Williamson](https://www.bitchute.com/video/oPni6CCugOHO/) was interviewed about his views on the Holocaust and among other statements he said “I believe that the historical evidence is strongly against, is hugely against six million Jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler” which soon after got him a 16,000 Euro fine for Holocaust denial. Since Jews understandably play a crucial role in pushing for the many laws across Europe that make criminals out of Holocaust Revisionists it is quite understandable how this only fuels some revisionists’ hatred of Jews or how it makes them even more susceptible to believing in Jewish conspiracies-etc. I can understand punishing someone for real ‘hate speech’, someone who writes an article trying to organize a mob to harm some people on a particular day or something along those lines. The many Jews whose fears are causing them to overreact and push for such draconian measures are making a mistake. The persecution these people face is also a clear violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 19 which reads:

>"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."


Another thing that got me interested in Holocaust revisionism, or to take it more seriously, is how the great historian Harry Elmer Barnes felt like the standard Holocaust narrative was also exaggerated. The fact that Jewish intellectual giant Murray N. Rothbard thought highly of Barnes and that I never found a single publication of Rothbard about the Holocaust also made me think that he too shared Barnes’ views but decided to avoid the consequences. Prior to myself understanding the potential evolution of this potential myth there would be a little voice in my head telling me “this Barnes guy might be an ‘anti-Semite’ which might slant his writings” but now my respect for this historian and man of intellectual courage grows even more. Articles about the Holocaust seemed virtually inexistent in the world’s most popular libertarian site, lewrockwell.com, and they sometimes ran articles by revisionist David Cole (non-Holocaust related articles). This further led me to believe that perhaps many believed in Revisionist arguments but astutely decided that discussing this subject might be more detrimental to spreading libertarianism at the time. As time went on I learned how many intellectual leaders which I will not mention also saw the mainstream narrative to have been a massive exaggeration, but, again, for understandable reasons have not found a way to discuss this subject in a manner where the tribalistic reaction can be avoided. 

Just like the more extreme elements of a religion are ‘naturally selected’ out of popularity (like the countless absurdities mentioned in the Old Testament), so would the more outrageous holocaust claims like making soap out of Jews and numerous others, leading only to a finely evolved myth like what perhaps we have today. The God of Abraham which Judaism, Christianity and Islam share, is easy to discard for many people, but the Holocaust supposedly has the physical evidence, the buildings, and the ‘gas chambers’. It is supposed to be grounded in a reality we can almost touch. Yet the same reasoning can apply to the creation and evolution of any myth. One can just as easily see how Holocaust Revisionists might simply pick and choose whatever information can be used to create a superficially convincing story which would require more and more time to debunk as it is refined more and more. In my limited research I’ve also found instances of gross exaggerations in some Revisionist oriented books. Among numerous incentives that can motivate people to become Revisionists besides the simple quest for truth and intellectual curiosity, people like Germar Rudolf have stated that after being pegged with the ‘Holocaust Denier’ label and sticking to his views he felt like he had no other choice but to make a living as a professional Revisionist author-publicist. Creating a potential conflict of interest. But then, the conflict of interest is even bigger for what Norman Finkelstein refers to as ‘The Holocaust Industry’. The difference is that ‘The Holocaust Industry’ like the Catholic Church of the past or the former Soviet government is incentivized to make criminals out of dissenters. And if they are ultimately proven wrong... Wow!

Next let us look at the story of arguably the most important revisionist today, German chemist Germar Rudolf. In 1994 Germar was a chemist working on his PhD at the prestigious Max Planck institute. At the request of a lawyer defending someone accused of participating in the mass-gassing narrative, he did some chemical analysis of the alleged Auschwitz gas chambers and created a report based on his research which concluded that the kind of mass gassings associated with the standard narrative could not have taken place as commonly described. Germar did not deny with 100% certainty that such gassings could have taken place. In a documentary about his ordeal he mentions:

>“It must have been at least in another way. You can't exclude absolutely that there have been any gassings, maybe by another poisonous gas, maybe just in a very small amount or maybe in other places in other ways. This is something you can't exclude [absolutely.”](https://www.bitchute.com/video/UHDKv2JsdAbo/)

When knowledge of his report reached German authorities they quickly apprehended him for inciting hatred. The German government and Jews throughout the world had a perfect opportunity to expose a holocaust doubter or a real malicious liar by clearly exposing errors or fabrications and lies in his chemistry report, yet this is not what happened. No team of hired government chemists would check the validity or lack-thereof in his work. Germar fled Germany before serving his sentence. About ten years later in 2005, married and with a child in the U.S., he was extradited back to Germany where he waited in jail for about 1.5 years for a trial to begin and then served an additional two years before getting out in July 2009. With respect to his trial Germar writes:

>"In my own 2007 court case I motioned to hear five mainstream historians, all of which would testify that the only reason why historians don't show any dissent about the Holocaust is because they are scared of being persecuted and prosecuted for it. And what was the judges' reaction to this?

>>"[the Motions] are rejected, because the gathering of this evidence is irrelevant for[Court's] decision, because even if the named persons would confirm the probative allegations, the Chamber would not question the self-evidence of the Holocaust"" (Rudolf, 'Resistance is Obligatory')

This should be appalling to most readers, especially those like myself with a deep understanding of the vital need for freedom and its emerging 'competitive knowledge discovery'. As part of his trial Germar gave long testimony explaining how such persecution went against everything "Western" culture had achieved and much more, and also took careful notes about the trial with the hope of someday publishing a book about the ordeal. From jail Germar exchanged his trial notes with a supporter by mail which would once again make him a criminal and astoundingly bring yet another prosecution when authorities read his mail and discovered he was planning to once again publish forbidden ideas. Let us assume that Germar is a charlatan and a well-intentioned curious person is persuaded by his views, and is now….a criminal. This helps show the cruelty and absurdity of making people criminals based on the ideas they hold. How ridiculous and wrongheaded is that! Laws restricting freedom of speech and making criminals out of people just because they hold ideas, even erroneous ones, are HORRENDOUS!

Given the unfortunate ethno-religious conflicts that have occurred with Jews through centuries, Jews being quick to bring attention or alarm to possible danger is an understandable part of their culture-identity. And this understandably means that from time to time, just due to pure statistics and probabilities, someone will exagerate a bit or a rumor will get more attention than it deserves. For example, below are just a few newspaper headlines calling attention to such ‘Holocausts’ long, long, long, long before the real one:

June 11, 1900 Rabbi Stephen S. Wise mentioned in the New York Times that “There are 6,000,000 living, bleeding, suffering arguments in favor of Zionism.”

Nov. 1st 1905 New York Times mentions “From 1890 to 1902 he caused 6,000,000 Jewish families to be expelled from Russia.”

1906 - New York Times, March 25th, 1906

>" ... the condition and future of Russia's 6,000,000 Jews were made on March 12 in Berlin to the annual meeting of the Central Jewish Relief League of Germany by Dr. Paul Nathan ... He left St. Petersburg with the firm conviction that the Russian Government’s studied policy for the “solution” of the Jewish question is systematic and murderous extermination."

1911 - Max Nordeau speaking at The 1911 Zionist Congress. Hecht, Ben. Perfidy. NY; Julian Messner. 1961. page 254

>"But the same righteous Governments, who are so nobly, industriously active to establish the eternal peace, are preparing, by their own confession, complete annihilation for six million people,"

‘Gas chamber’ rumors leading to potential Holocaust myths also made it to prominent newspapers during World War One. On March 22nd 1916, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph published an article falsely claiming that the Germans had murdered 700,000 Serbs in gas chambers. So as one can see, seeds of gigantic myths were sprouting all the time and the combination of factors already discussed could have helped the standard Holocaust narrative continue to grow, as we will continue to explain.

It is vitally important to realize that Holocaust Denial laws are NOT the result of some sinister plot by "The Jews" to silence criticism of their alleged 'gas-chamber hoax' as so many naive thinkers or "antisemites" claim, it is the understandable reaction to the crude fallacies-antisemitism of the misguided Horst Mahler types! I have little doubt in my mind that if everyone who doubts various aspects or completely denies the existence of homicidal gas-chambers, would do so in a non-foolish accusatory or conspiratorial manner, in a blame-free way that seeks to understand the true cause of the misunderstandings and historical events, that such laws would NOT exist and thus freedom and emerging 'competitive knowledge discovery' would get mankind as close to the truth as we can. My guess is that if just 10 Germans or Austrians or one or two celebrities created a pro-freedom-of-speech event where they openly critisized the standard narrative, and treated it as the evolution of a complex myth, free of 'antisemetic tropes', it would create a media sensation and enough sympathy and dialogue to overturn such laws. Sadly for every courteous and considerate David Cole, Paul Eisen, and Germar Rudolf who heroically follow their conscience without falling for antisemitic nonsense, there are 100,000 naive thinkers, or of the Horst Mahler type, which then understandably causes 'the baby to be thrown out with the bathwater', causing every critic or doubter to be seen as a potentially dangerous antisemite. If 10 Horst Mahler types do a demonstration, then unfortunately they will go to jail and perhaps lead to even more draconian laws. 

There are other more complex sort of evolutionary factors. Imagine two Jewish organizations, one hires Leah who is very concerned with Catholics who have many among them who believe "The Jews" killed Jesus and she is very good at finding Horst Mahler types and does a great job of writing about them and bringing attention to "antisemitism" and concerend citizens send the organization many donations due to the understandable fear and concern and great job the organization is doing. Another organization hires Daniel who has a good understanding of the various fallacies leading to antisemitism and writes well thought out complex articles, that do not scare people into donating. The first organization will get more money with which to grow and spread more fear and more of the idea that anyone who doubts the standard narrative is a Horst Mahler type and the concerned citizens and politicians pass denial laws and so on. The misguided "antisemites" then see this as a "conspiracy" by "The Jews" to silence them and prevent them from "exposing" their nefarious plans. So the relatively naive and ignorant simpletons or "extremists" on both sides end up essentially spreading naive good vs. evil thinking eventually driving the legal system, with the "antisemites" restricting the freedom of Jews as happened in Germany, or the Jews likewise silencing the antisemites and those who unfortunately agree with them in some regards like the gas-chamber doubters-revisionists. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) essentially has evolved this way. It amplifies naive antisemitism to the public, which brings in more money, which it uses to grow and become better and better at finding "antisemitism", which brings in more money and so on, eventually, inadvertently persuading the entire Western World that even though we no longer have the 'burn in hell' type of religious evil in our more secularized world, we do have the 'antisemitic forces', 'the oldest hatred', etc. Since the "intellectuals" at the ADL and most Jews unfortunately simply lack the intellectual tools needed to understand the fallacies which then lead to antisemitism, all they can do is spread pseudo-science and quasi-religious psychobabble about the horrible antisemites and need to silence them in order to prevent the spread of antisemitism or "hate". Which of course is then seen by the naive antisemites as further proof of how "The Jews" control everything and want to silence them intensifying the polarizations. This is easily seen in the countless documentaries about Hitler which always portray him, not as a fellow homo sapiens who absorbed erroneous ideas, but as some weird-mystical-maniacal-“psychopathic” creation. A perfect example of this pattern was displayed in a [discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVXcIcIBtTU) between rapper Charlemagne and president of the ADL Jonathan Greenblatt regarding the understandable hatred and attempt to silence and bankrupt KanYE West which so many Jews understandably want, which went as follows:

>Charlemagne: "You all are proving someone like KanYE right, because someone like KanYE says 'Hey, Jewish people have all the power', and then, he loses everything."

>Greenblatt: "Well, look...the insedious nature of antisemitism and his jokes about power...KanYE can say these things 'Jews have all the power, they control everything'... And if we don't deal with that the myths spreads and it takes root."

The only way a myth and fallacies can be sustained is via the coercion that prevents freedom and emerging 'competitive knowledge discovery' from working. This requires an ever-increasing all-powerful survailence state which adherents of Holocaustianity inevitably have to setup in their holy-misguided quest to root out "evil" or "hate". 

Greenblatt further explains how today's leading social media companies are spying on everyone:

>"we've been fighting hate for again over almost 110 years. Facebook is the front line the fighting hate today, and social media is a super spreader of anti-black racism anti-jewish hate anti-asian hate Etc. so literally we opened a center in Silicon Valley back in 2017. And the woman who runs it she's and ex-Facebook executive. I have software engineers and data scientists working at ADL we're monitoring all this stuff and we're working with all the platforms by the way Google and YouTube and meta and Twitter and Reddit and steam and Amazon all these companies. From like apple to zoom we work with all of them okay. That's relevant because we've been working with Twitter now... since it was founded. We work with the old regime, working with the new regime."

To my knowledge there is nothing in the ADL's website about the root causes of the misunderstandings and fallacies that lead to antisemitism. Just history of 'Jewish Suffering', and what can be described as psychobabble and pseudo-science, which is, again, understandable. If you are not starting from the fact all human beings are fellow homo sapiens, and then looking at the complex evolution of ideas, identities, etc. and how these lead to conflict, free from mysticism, and full of sympathy for everyone without "blaming" someone, you are doing it wrong. Such understandable ignorance can only lead to the need to silence and kill the antisemites. And we of course see a similar reaction from the naive antisemites. Also, as with religious coercion and the Soviet bureucrats, or any social growth whose foundational ideas are ultimately discarded, the entire existence of their respective bureaucracies  and the very 'identity' of their members depend on people believing such ideas or myths. This understandably creates complex incentives that causes the ADL to be as neglectful of competing ideas as the latter two. Socialist bureaucrats in the former Soviet Union were not seeking out dialogue with free market intellectuals, neither do religious leaders look forward to discussing things with biologist Richard Dawkins, and likewise the last thing the ADL or priesthood of Holocaustianity in Yad Vashem are incentivized to do is have a dialog with people who may show them that they have devoted their lives to a myth. As Daniel Dennett famously said “There’s simply no polite way to tell people they’ve dedicated their lives to an illusion.” The ADL, the entire Zionist 'Identity' and resulting Israeli state essentially shares this ideology which inadvertently permeates throughout the Western World. 

Also look at organizations like Palestinian Media Watch (palwatch.org) which closely monitors the TV/Media of Palestinians in the West Bank and especially Gaza. They show the "good people" in America and Europe, especially since Jews are so successful and as already mentioned are overtly represented in the media, how those radical Muslims have school plays where children act out terrorist acts, which of course is a gold-mine that then also easily proves just how irrational and messed up the Palestinians are and how the civilized Jews can never have peace with such people and so on. Like a "racist" white "Republican" who clamors for harsher and harsher penalties for drug crimes, and feels like the young black youth who are trapped in the drug war deserve their fate and then relishes amongst his friends about how supposedly uncivilized black people are, much of the Jewish world likewise inadvertently fools itself regarding the Palestinians and Islamic world. As with any large number of people, the percentage of well educated and thoughful Jews who clearly understand that the radicalization of Palestinians in places like Gaza is the result of complex historical factors is just too small and not influential enough compared to your average simple-minded-tribalistic homo sapiens who has absorbed a "Jewish identity" and given complex factors fools himself into numerous fallacies. Again! Again! Vitally importnat! This process, is NOT the result of a sinister conspiracy of malicious Jews. It is just homo sapiens with their "identities" and complex circumstances doing something that is ultimately "indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design”. 

It is all about ideas, how they arise, move through populations, how each mind given its current ideology and incentives reacts to the ideas, etc. Here we can once again apply vital lessons from the intellectual battle vs. Socialist-Communist mythology. The most important fighters against Socialism-Communism where 'The Austrians' who did NOT vilify socialists, Menger-Mises-Hayek-friends understood all the fallacies and complex dynamics. They did NOT see Socialism-Communism as some malicious plot by some to rule over others, and obviously much less a 'Jewish plot', or the work of the Devil as so many religious people though was behind Communism given its anti-Religion views. The 'Austrians' can be seen as the very inner core of the message of freedom and how the world works. Now, like the children's game of telephone, where an initial message is passed on from one person to the next and after ten people you have something very different than the original message. Something similar happens with social myths like Socialism-Communism and also Holocaustianity. In a layer outside of the economists you had a much much much larger number of Catholics or religious people who were against Socialism-Communism and these people would sometimes learn from or use some of the arguments of the economists to combat Socialism-Communism, but they generally saw the atheist Communists and their attacks on the Church as malicious or devilish, etc. and then these two much larger groups understandably polarized and attacked each other. The same happens with Holocaustianity. At the very core you have the science and fact-based revisionists who don't see Holocaustianity as some sinister plot by Jews but rightly see it as an immensely complex myth, the Paul Eisens, Germar Rudolphs, and sadly a very small number of revisionists-doubters who do not fall for antisemitic or racist tropes and other fallacies. Then outside this small core you have a massive number of naive Holocaust deniers-doubters who will use some of the findings or arguments of the core revisionists, but dress them up with their naive and misguided antisemitic tropes. And then of course you have those who are firm believers in Holocaustianity who then see the fallacies of the antisemites and both groups fight it out. So the real wisdom and insights of 'The Austrians' as well as revisionists-doubters is so diluted and misinterpreted that hardly anyone will know who they really are. For example, regarding economics, Ludwig von Mises, like Menger and Hayek was a profound evolutionary thinker, yet the Ludwig von Mises Institute (mises.org) which bears his name is run mostly by religious people which inadvertently misrepresents various aspects of his views. Again, the game of telephone. The vast majority of people on "The Left" see free market thinkers as part of "right wing ideology", something somewhat connected or rooted in religion, when the truth is that the very core of the greatest economists can be said to have been even more Darwinian than Darwin. The exact same thing happens with Holocaust revisionism, the naive simple-minded antisemites, whether the Muslim or Catholic type or whatever, dominate how revisionism or doubt or denial is spread, thus once again what reaches the public is deeply misguided.

Next let’s quickly answer some common Holocaust related fallacies that help perpetuate the potential myth on a superficial level.

1. What about the skinny bodies we see being dumped in mass graves? There is no controversy here; during the last months of the war as Germany was completely destroyed it became impossible to provide adequate food or care for the people in the camps. Malnutrition and diseases like typhus came as a result. Camps kept meticulous records of deaths and the official records easily show how during the last months of the war deaths skyrocketed. The ‘Evil Nazi’ myth makes us believe that somehow the sinister Germans enjoyed creating such conditions but this might not have been the case. Below is a picture of the evil Auschwitz staff.

Evil Nazis for sure. They do a good job of making it look like they are nice conservative proper German girls. But we all know that they were gripped by a sinister anti-Semitic spell that made them impervious to gassing millions of Jews. Don’t look too long because the evil spirits will get you too.

The fact that these people above look so normal would eventually give birth to many books-articles about the ‘psychology of evil’ trying to rationalize how these seemingly nice and professional looking people could have seemed so nice while at the same time allegedly committing such heinous gassings at Auschwitz. The much simpler argument that does not require psychobabble which Revisionists make is that they weren’t gassing anybody.

2. What about all the eyewitnesses? To answer this, I quote Germar Rudolf’s introduction to Holocaust Revisionism:

>“During the war crimes trials many "eyewitnesses" testified that Germans made soap out of human fat and lamp shades from human skin. Allied prosecutors even produced evidence to support these charges. For decades, highly respected scholars at the most prestigious universities in the world sanctioned these stories, leading us to believe that such stories were "irrefutable truths." But within time, many such stories have become untenable: In 1990, Yehuda Bauer, director of Holocaust studies at Hebrew University, Tel Aviv, admitted: "The Nazis never made soap from Jews…" (Jerusalem Post, Int. Ed., 5 May 1990, p. 6).

>Bruno Baum, a former communist inmate in Auschwitz, was allowed to brag in summer 1945 in a Soviet newspaper: "The whole propaganda which started about Auschwitz abroad was initiated by us [German communist inmates] with the help of our Polish comrades." (Deutsche Volkszeitung, Soviet paper in occupied East Germany, 31 July 1945). Thus, it is not surprising to learn that during several trials in Germany, it emerged that the testimony of witnesses from eastern Europe had been orchestrated by communist authorities.

>During a trial against an alleged former camp guard in Jerusalem, even the Israeli court had to admit that all witness testimony was not credible, which resulted in the defendant’s acquittal.”

The trial Rudolf is referring to is that of John Demjanjuk. The US government stumbled upon some Soviet documents that identified John as having been in the SS and worked at the Sobibor camp. Pictures of him were eventually identified by several holocaust survivors who would testify in court as John being ‘Ivan the Terrible’ who operated the gas chambers at Auschwitz. He got the death penalty which he appealed. Miraculously, the judge died during the appeal proceedings and during this time, 1990, the Soviet Union collapses and Soviet files become available which showed that the files the US had originally obtained about him were forgeries to be used in some plot and he was allowed to go free. What does this say about the eyewitnesses?  Eyewitness misidentification is the single greatest cause of wrongful convictions nationwide, playing a role in more than 75% of convictions overturned through DNA testing. Again, this does not mean that every eyewitness is a liar, there are many reasons I won’t go into here that can lead to such mistakes. But of course there are liars too. Imagine you are one of the many Jews living in Israel who got uprooted and suffered so much at the hands of the Germans, even if you weren’t sure John had been the real ‘Ivan the Terrible’ You or someone in a similar situation might think along the lines of “who cares! John was an evil camp guard anyways, why let him get away because of the lack of real witnesses?”

Rudolf continues:

>"During and after the war there were "eyewitnesses" to mass gassings at Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen, Dachau, and other camps in Germany proper. Today, virtually all recognized scholars dismiss this testimony as false."

3. What about the Zyklon B - Cyanide being used at camps for gassings?

No historian, even the ones that defend the standard Holocaust narrative claim that there were homicidal gassings at the Dachau camp. What anyone who spends at least 30 minutes learning about German concentrations camps will learn, is that inmates’ clothing was deloused(def. “rid (a person or animal) of lice and other parasitic insects") in special gas-chambers. Again, no historian denies this. It is easy to see how rumors about throwing inmates into chambers could easily and ultimately spread.

Among the many and courageous revisionists-doubters out there, we should again highlight the importance of Jewish-born ones like David Cole, and Paul Eisen who is inadvertently one of the most influential people in the world you have never heard of. People who are "raised right" are supposed to care about human suffering regardless of where they are, they are supposed to stand up for the truth and so on. If Zionism has been a mistake, AND the gas-chamber maniacal exterminationist narrative also a myth, then it makes perfect sense that eventually Jews with the moral fortitude to criticize both and encourage fellow Jews to join will arise, and that is precisely what we have with Paul Eisen and many others. Like so many Jews who see their history and circumstances involved in so much chaos, he was one of the many that overcame the understandable tribalism-my-side-is-always-right-type of thinking and created an organization rightly titled righteousjews.org. Eisen and similar Jews are for Zionism and Holocaust exaggerations what men like Max Eastman were for Socialism, people who were able to think independently, admit that they had devoted much of their lives to spreading misguided myths, and make it their moral duty to fight a very uphill battle. We quote a bit from his article ['How I Became a Holocaust Denier'](https://www.righteousjews.org/article37.html) where Eisen describes growing up fully immersed in the 'Zionism and the Holocaust' sort of religion and 'Identity' of most Jews:

>"My family were ordinary folk—'twice-a-year Jews' we used to call them. But like most of us second and third generation, upwardly mobile, North London Jews, our Jewishness filled our lives. And, at that time, that meant Zionism and the Holocaust. For me, my family, and our friends, a post-Holocaust Israel meant quite simply 'never again'.
But, while seemingly ordinary, my family was also rather extraordinary. My father was unusually tolerant and free-thinking, and my mother too was unusually lively in her thinking. A born rebel, there was nothing she loved more than to burst a balloon. As for me, I started off, first as the family tsaddik—awfully concerned with God and my Jewishness (though always strangely at odds with other Jews)—then the family dissident-intellectual. By young adulthood, you would have found me somewhere on the Zionist left—unquestioning in my support for the Jewish state but wishing it would not behave quite so badly and stop embarrassing me in front of my friends. However, when it came to the Holocaust, my faith was unwavering.

After changing his mind he nicely summarizes how civilization is sort of intellectually oppressed by the new religion of Holocaustianity. (I wished he used the word 'myth' instead of 'lie' below):

>"why the fuss, why the witch-hunt, why the imprisonment of David Irving, Ernst Zündel and Germar Rudolf? And it's not just them. What may be a massive lie is being used to oppress pretty much all of humankind. The German and Austrian peoples who, we are told, conceived and perpetrated the slaughter; the Russian, Polish, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, Rumanian, Hungarian, peoples etc. who supposedly hosted, assisted in and cheered on the slaughter; the Americans, the British, the French, the Dutch, the Belgians, the Italians (but not the Danes and the Bulgarians) etc. who apparently didn't do enough to stop the slaughter; the Swiss who earned out of the slaughter, and the entire Christian world who, it seems, created the faith-traditions and ideologies in which the slaughter could take place, and now the Palestinian, Arab and Muslim peoples who seemingly want to perpetrate a new slaughter—in fact, the Holocaust oppresses the entire non-Jewish world and indeed much of the Jewish world as well. Stand up and have done with it.

A discussion between Paul Eisen and Gilad Atzmon:

>Paul Eisen: "it's not about the Holocaust... it's free thought...decent treatment of other people"

>Gilad Atzmon: "yeah that's what it's about. And these are the most
precious values of Western Society in which we are living...the fact that we cannot deal with the most crucial chapter of our recent history is the most frightening symptom of the zionification of our society"

>Paul Eisen: "we are in the year 2011 in the most advanced part of the world and people are being put into prison for having a point of view"

Once Jews become secular enough, once they wake up to the reality that all human beings are just fellow homo sapiens who have inadvertently picked up an "identity" that is just based on the luck of being born in a particular time and place, once they understand how people who absorbed a 'Zionist Identity' simply made a monumental yet understandable error as fellow groups of homo sapiens do all the time, once they understand the horrible and complex sequence of events and ideas which can lead to antisemitism and some of the horrible things that perhaps some fellow human beings (Palestinians) can say in Gaza, and understandably see past the errors and see the common humanity and how peace and a different outlook can end the hatreds, then, as happened with so many like Gilad Atzmon, Shlomo Sand and countless others, they simply stop 'identifying as Jews' and all the 'identity problems' melt away. Which is of course a massive problem for Zionists. Those very well educated secular Jews who have so much "power" as many naive antisemites lament are an important Achilles heel in helping overcome the above problems. 

Eisen is "one of the most influential people in the world you have never heard of" because Jeremy Corbyn, one of England's most popular politicians and the Labor Party he has headed is always destroyed via accusations of being antisemitic due to his brief acquaintance with Eisen. 

Although  Hitler’s actions obviously brought many Jews a terrible fate, the idea that long before the war Hitler was hell-bent on exterminating all the Jews seems more like the result of jingoistic propaganda just like ‘Germans bayonetting Belgian babies’ was. By 2015, 70 years after the end of the war, not a single Nazi government document has shown any evidence of a program of deliberate extermination of the Jews. This does not mean that I don’t think Hitler would have loved for all Jews to disappear from the planet. What I mean is that given his means, which includes popular opinion against such barbarism, he would not have given such an option much thought. Forced migrations of millions of people is already horrendous enough but the truth is the truth (I could be wrong of course). Even well into the war, some sort of forced migration of Jews was still Hitler’s goal. Moving them to occupied Poland was looked at; moving them to Madagascar was also seriously considered(by the French too); moving them further east into the Soviet Union was also considered but Stalin did not want them, but this became the policy after Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. The Allies even had access to secret-encrypted communication from concentration camps like Auschwitz and nothing about ‘gas chambers’ and plenty about the sorts of things you’d expect.

Freedom and competition are what create order-life and there is a link between the Holocaust and the very existence of the social order. In order to have peace and prosperity and avoid The Final World War, peace and the cooling off of the constant war-mongering we see in the world needs to be toned down. Most of the warmongering is either directly related to or an outgrowth of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which is just an outgrowth of Jew-Gentile misunderstandings whose root causes we have tried to explain. And the Holocaust has inadvertently evolved to be the root, or new trunk, from which many fallacies grow. During the 2015 presidential debates Mike Huckabee said that allowing the Iranian nuclear deal would be like marching Israelis “to the door of the oven”. British Prime Minister David Cameron mentioned that the British were "appeasing Putin as we did Hitler" due to the troubles in Ukraine(long before current war). The Holocaust constantly radiates the fallacy that there is some kind of mysterious sinister evil force out there which the forces of good must fight, it takes us away from focusing on the ideas and economic fallacies which are the real source of our problems. Secular thinkers believe that Darwin triumphed over religious mysticism, not really, as long as Holocaustianity keeps today's 'leading intellectuals' tolerating its draconian coercive monopoly on information via Holocaust denial laws, as well as seeing Hitler and Nazi leadership as some mythical "evil" monsters instead of fellow homo sapiens who made understandable errors given certain ideas, mysticism still triumphs over Darwin. But again! This is NOT the "fault" of fellow homo sapiens who have absorbed a "Jewish Identity" or culture-software. And likewise, this is also NOT the fault of the naive antisemites. Who came first? The chicken or the egg?

If it is true that the standard Holocaust narrative is off as the revisionists claim, overcoming this myth, which is brutally sustained by force in many European countries, will obviously need freedom of speech and its strongest defenders. And as things are today my guess is that the strongest beacon of freedom still remains the United States, and especially America's Libertarians. Since American Libertarians are the strongest defenders of freedom, it is understandable how they gain the benefits of emergent 'competitive knowledge discovery' and thus understandably have what I'm guessing is the largest proportion of Holocaust doubters-deniers, just like I'm sure they also had the largest number of people who saw through the idiotic centrally planned CovidMania lockdowns and coerced bullshit vaccinations. Again, the more you defend freedom, the more likely you are to gain the benefits of 'competitive knowledge discovery', be less trusting of the central planning apes and their always-inferior centrally planned ideas and myths. The ignorance that runs the masses and their politicians, will eventually try to topple the First Amendment and make 'Holocaust Denial' 'hate speech', and thus a criminal act. And if the mainstream ignorant masses start making the obvious stupid mistake of now labeling Libertarians as “anti-Semites” and prevents the libertarian message, especially the Austrian Economics that it carries from spreading, then it is just a matter of time before mankind inevitably  self-destroys.

If the maniacal purposeful extermination via mass-gassings is a myth, then the most courageous and principled people can be found questioning it, sadly for understandable reasons some vary naive antisemites end up there as well. Another one of the numerous heroes I'd like to briefly bring attention to is Doug Christie, Ernst Zundle's lawyer. The type of man who would volunteer to trade himself for hostages in dangerous [situations.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtfvCpcoRu0). 


During the early 20th century and with the rise of Hitler it would have been great if leaders understood  that 1) Jews’ overrepresentation in the atheistic communist ideology was perhaps the overriding factor in their dislike, and 2) to a lesser degree their overrepresentation in “Capitalist” institutions like banking and finance and massive economic ignorance by the public who saw this as “bad”. Unfortunately it seems like mainstream Jewish leaders see their ill-treatment at the time as the result of the disease-like concept of “anti-Semitism” and not as having anything to do with the aforementioned two. This is understandable of course and nobody is to blame for it. Besides people like the great Jewish economist Ludwig von Mises, we know Jews, as well as most of the world, was clueless about economics and how unworkable and disastrous socialism was bound to be. Today we see the same thing. Although there is no longer a communist movement like there was in the early 20th century, there is still the “Jewish Bankers” conspiratorial thinking which is a small factor in today’s anti-Semitism, but what you do have is 3) the ongoing disaster in Palestine, with the occupation, the wars, the surrounding misery, the fundamentalist-racist-hyper-religious Jewish settlers who want to colonize the West Bank and so much more. Yet with all this obvious chaos and the anti-Semitism that it brings, many Jews are simply impervious to this and once again see the disease-like concept of “anti-Semitism” as being the reason why Israel is increasingly disliked. What we want to do is identify a repeating pattern. Some homo sapiens make numerous errors leading to antisemitism, Jews and sympathetic supporters treat the antisemites not as misguided homo sapiens, but as some "evil" people, and the calamities repeat. Had more intellectuals of influence understood Hitler's fallacies, the naive vilification of his government and inevitable polarization leading to World War Two could have been avoided. Hitler's misguided 'conspiratorial' views regarding Jews are still very popular and one of the root causes of the hatreds between Iran and Israel and their respective allies. For example, on July 28, 2022, Iran's Supreme Ruler Ali Khamenei tweeted the following:

>"The Western powers are a mafia. The reality of this power is a mafia. At the top of this mafia stand the prominent Zionist merchants, and the politicians obey them. The US is their showcase, and they’re spread out everywhere."

Classic antisemitic trope implying the existence of some sinister conspiracy of Jews which controls the US.

This is bad, but the reaction by United States Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating Anti-Semitism, Deborah Lipstadt is also disastrous but in a more subtle way. She tweets:

>"This rhetoric is unacceptable – not to mention dangerous – especially from a head of state. It must cease."

Again, the reason why her tweet it disastrous is because Lipstadt, as well as most Jews unfortunately, not really understanding the root causes of Khamenei's errors, is left with condescending rhetoric and demands that Khamenei stop expressing his views. This interaction is in many ways an intellectual microcosm of the Jew-Gentile frictions that played a vital role in problems going back centuries, World War Two, and the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and all that emerges from it. Some homo sapiens make numerous errors leading to antisemitism, Jews and sympathetic supporters treat the antisemites not as misguided homo sapiens, but as some "evil" people, and the polarizations and inevitable calamities repeat. Further complicating matters is the fact that Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish. Zelenskyy told Israeli politicians in a Zoom meeting "You can mediate between countries, but not between good and evil." Again, the inevitable emergence of the simplistic-tribalistic 'good and evil' mythical thinking you need for large groups of homo sapiens to slaughter each other. Zelensky is also trying to portray the good relations between Russia and Iran leading to Russians helping Iran acquire nuclear weapons. He mentioned: "Is Iran just interested in money? Probably not money at all, but Russian assistance to the Iranian nuclear program Probably, this is exactly the meaning of their alliance." 

<img src="../../images/putiniran.png" alt="Putin and Khamenei"
	title="Putin and Khamenei" width="300" height="500" />

Although Putin and his government are nowhere near as ‘antisemitic’ as Hitler’s was, Putin’s government gets along very well with strong critics of Israel and Zionism like Syria and Iran. Keeping with long established United Nations traditions going back to 1949 Russia recognizes territory in northern Israel referred to as the ‘Golan Heights’ as belonging to Syria, not Israel. The most important Palestinian leader, President of the Palestinian National Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, considers Russia to be a fairer and more impartial collaborator for peace than the USA. He told Putin:

>“We don’t trust America…We don’t trust it, we don’t rely on it, and under no circumstances can we accept that America is the sole party in resolving a problem,”…”Russia stands by justice and international law and that is enough for us,”….”we are happy and satisfied with the Russian position.”

Besides a nearly incapacitated and clearly senile US President Biden, arguably the most powerful US politician, especially as it relates to war and foreign policy, is the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken who is a Zionist Jew and understandably sees Iran and Syria as some of the most sinister-evil countries in the world given their attitude towards Israel-Zionism and clearly antisemmitic views of many of their leaders or bureucrats.

The above factors and image with three consecutive tweets from Khamenei understandably cause Jews and their sympathetic supporters in the USA and Europe to create an intellectual aura that paints Russia-Putin, as, you guessed it, the next irrational maniacal Hitler, and radiate a naïve "good vs. evil" mentality that can only lead to World War as happened in World War Two. Bottom line, the patterns are just repeating. Hitler miscalculated how his antisemitism would turn the US, England, and other major powers against him regardless of his very reasonable proposals for Danzig reunification, especially once he felt he had no choice but to reunite Danzig by force by invading Poland. Putin, just like Hitler, felt he needed to use force-invasion to bring independence or reunification to many ethnic Russians who were stuck living under a Ukrainian government they despised. Putin miscalculated how his support for critics of Zionism-Israel like Syria, Iran, Abbas, etc. would likewise turn Jews and once again the USA and other major powers against his very reasonable desire to somehow bring independence or non-Ukrainian rule to ethnic Russians living in Eastern Ukraine. Both Hitler and Putin were-are fellow homo sapiens, both actually very experienced and in many ways astute and accomplished world leaders, yet both found themselves portrayed as some irrational evil monsters due to disastrous antisemitism as in the case of Hitler, or having friendly relations with countries and intellectuals that are very critical of Israel and Zionism to various degrees, and also make misguided antisemitic statements which makes it very easy for Jews and their supporters to then ignore, vilify, bomb them (many Islamic leaders and politicians).

We must emphasize that antisemitism and resulting Zionist 'identity' and all that grows from them are just intellectual errors, two sides of the same fallacy, understandably committed by very bright and oftentimes admirable people based on prevailing ideas and what are essentially myths. Catholic-religious oppression was implemented by bright and pious people, the same applies to Communism, as well as the recent CovidMania and the countless doctors and medical professionals that went along with lockdowns and coerced bullshit vaccinations.

Communism, just like antisemitism, is the result of numerous intellectual errors. Labeling Communists as "evil" or crazy of psychopaths is NOT what led to its relative demise. It was Menger and his intellectual descendants of the so-called 'Austrian School' like Mises and Hayek who managed to help enough people overcome the fallacies which led to the tyranny. Similarly, simply labeling misguided "antisemites" as evil is NOT what will end antisemitism and emerging polarizations and wars. All physical threats and acts of coercion are ultimately rooted in economic ignorance and must be understood as such. 

I am reminded of Carl Menger’s insights as to the evolution of money, law, and states. They apply just as much to antisemitism, Zionism, and Socialism-Communism:

>“they still do not prove to be the result of an intention aimed at this purpose, i.e., the result of an agreement of members of society or of positive legislation. They, too, present themselves to us rather as “natural” products(in a certain sense), as unintended results of historical development.”

Yes, "The Jews", or better said, 'Jewish identity-culture' have played significant roles in the evolution or development of Capitalism and the free-market, yet "they" did not invent it as a tool for world dominance or prosperity. Yes "they" gave us the 'Ten Commandments', birthed Christianity and Islam and ultimately 'The Social Organism'. Yes they played a significant role in the spread of Socialism, yet they did not invent it as a tool for world dominance. Yes they played a crucial role in the World War Two disaster and obviously the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and all that arises from it, yet “they” should not be blamed or given credit for them either.
