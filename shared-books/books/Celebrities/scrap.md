Thus using government to redistribute wealth and 

 where expecting the government to take wealth from whites-others, whether via some kind of reparations or spending in government provided services which would benefit them at the expense of the wealthier whites, are all things that seem like good and fair ideas to many, and this obviously plays a huge role in politics and eventually economics. The great economist Ludwig von Mises tells us:

>"All present-day political issues concern problems commonly called economic. All arguments advanced in contemporary discussion of social and public affairs deal with fundamental matters of…economics. Everybody's mind is preoccupied with economic doctrines…Everybody thinks of economics whether he is aware of it or not. In joining a political party and in casting his ballot, the citizen implicitly takes a stand upon essential economic theories"




The Holocaust is what proves to many people that the world is "irrational", that somehow there is this unknown evil out there, that can turn even the hard-working courteous Germans into some irrational and maniacal killers. It is what proves in the minds of so many fellow homo sapiens who have absorbed a 'Jewish Identity', especially Zionists, that there is something deeply wrong with the homo sapiens who have NOT absorbed a 'Jewish Identity' where somehow they can end up doing things like this, and that this obviously necessitates a separate country for the homo sapiens who have absorbed a 'Jewish Identity'.
