### Race Relations


In introduction we briefly highlighted how economic ignorance understandably leads both blacks and the increasingly sympathetic whites to mistakenly see racism as a significant source of black's and "minorities" relative problems. I know this is a rather crude generalization but there is some truth to it... In many ways racist fallacies and thorny relations between blacks and whites in the US, inadvertently played a significant role in saving civilization from Socialist mythology. To a significant degree, the desire to not share wealth with blacks was a significant factor in America’s rejection of Socialist mythology. Had the US had a more homogeneous all-white population, the appeal to share the wealth via socialism would have been stronger and likely have succeeded in taking the US towards Soviet Union-like Communism during the 1920s-1940s. This also helps us understand how as America and the whole world fell in love with great musicians like The Platters, The Supremes, The Temptations, Dionne Warwick, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and countless others... as mostly white people filled stadiums cheering on mostly black athletes, in other words, as we became less racist and sympathized with black's ill-treatment and relative lack of prosperity, we understandably saw wealth redistribution and various socialist-government schemes as a way to help, inadvertently destroying the very freedom and emerging and increasing socioeconomic harmony that had been occurring, leading to where we are today. 

During the days of slavery, black people obviously wanted freedom. Real freedom. The freedom to keep the fruits of their labor, to work for themselves, to compete freely with whites without any government coercion interfering with them. As already mentioned, freedom and competition is what has evolved our morals-ethics-culture to be hard-working, tolerant and treat everyone with respect and overcame the aforementioned problems created by slavery. Unfortunately blacks didn't just get increasing freedom, they also got constant 'social engineering'-Socialism from well-intentioned whites which did more harm than good. Frederick Douglass' advice below was just as important then as it is today (perhaps even more so today):

>“Everybody has asked the question. . .“What shall we do with the Negro?” I have had but one answer from the beginning. Do nothing with us! Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us. Do nothing with us! If the apples will not remain on the tree of their own strength, if they are wormeaten at the core, if they are early ripe and disposed to fall, let them fall! I am not for tying or fastening them on the tree in any way, except by nature's plan, and if they will not stay there, let them fall. And if the Negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall also. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his own legs! Let him alone!”

Frederick Douglass also said a few words that carry more wisdom than anything coming out of the mouths of all American psychiatrists combined: *“Men are so constituted that they derive their conviction of their own possibilities largely from the estimate formed of them by others.”*  During slavery, long after, and probably still to this very day, some black people must have felt that they in fact were inferior to whites. This was just inevitable-understandable given that all the technology, the ability to read-write and just about everything that was much more advanced compared to what blacks had achieved was associated with white people. And of course, the "experts" and "the science" of the day had all sorts of explanations as to why blacks were inferior and needed whites to make them more productive-civilized. For example in 1851, American physician Samuel A. Cartwright hypothesized that a mental illness he called *Drapetomania* caused slaves to flee captivity. Believe it or not, sometimes the established "science"-Faucis can be wrong.

Given the deteriorating racial and economic situation brought about by economic ignorance, the public is looking for answers, unfortunately they are understandably drawn to the same simplistic fallacies which again we can summarize as "Capitalism is the racist white man's tool to enrich himself at the expense of women and minorities" For example, books like Robin DiAngelo's "White Fragility" are spreading the usual simplistic "identity"-based and anti-capitalist and thus anti-freedom and pro-coercion fallacies. For example, she writes:

>"...the US economy was based on the abduction and enslavement of African people, the displacement and genocide of indigenous people, and the annexation of Mexican lands"(p. 15-16)

Wrong. Those things certainly occurred, but they were NOT the "base" or most important factors leading to the rising standard of living Americans, and the entire planet, would enjoy as US-made discoveries and innovations spread globally. The US economy was "based" on Capitalism(albeit a very imperfect one of course), on a relatively strong respect for private property and the emergent competitive knowledge discovery and superior social order it leads to, as well as the "identity" of the fellow slightly smarter apes that best reflects the TRUTH, that regarding the things that really matter all human beings are equal slightly smarter apes regardless of the cultural-tribalistic baggage we have inherited from by-gone centuries. 

Unfortunately DiAngelo and the well-intentioned people who always fall for some coercive-monopoly central plan have transformed blacks from rapidly-progressing free-market competitors to being largely dependent on unproductive-damaging government jobs, thus their wealth, is increasingly that which is coerced from others. 

Patrick J. Buchanan summarizes in an article titled [“Obama's Race-Based Spoils System”](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2011/08/patrick-j-buchanan/is-it-a-racial-spoils-system/) 8/29/2011

>“Though only 12 percent to 13 percent of the U.S. population, blacks hold 18 percent of all federal jobs. African-Americans are 25 percent of the employees at Treasury and Veterans Affairs, 31 percent of State Department employees, 37 percent of the Department of Education, 38 percent of Housing and Urban Development. They are 42 percent of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 55 percent of the Government Printing Office, 82 percent of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency.

>According to The Washington Post, blacks hold 44 percent of the jobs at Fannie Mae and 50 percent of the jobs at Freddie Mac.” 

Blacks, whites, Nicaraguans, Cubans, Indians are just fellow homo sapiens, who just need economic freedom. That's all.
