# Real Science Requires Real Freedom: An Introduction To ‘Austrian Economics’ And The Libertarian Party’s Science Caucus.



## Preface.

This book-project is a collaborative Open Source project put together by the Freemarketeers writing group, a group of people who feel like they have had the immense fortune of having stumbled upon the proper understanding of the functioning and evolution of the socio-economic order as provided by the economists known as 'The Austrian School of Economics'. The ideas of men like Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, 1974 Nobel Laureate in Economics F.A. Hayek, Murray N. Rothbard and others, are not only vital for understanding the emergence and workings of the social order, but also our geopolitical conflicts like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Russia-Ukraine war, and the recent CovidMania and related tyranny and chaos.  

Just like the Linux operating system can be continuously improved and propagated by many people, we likewise hope that the Open Source nature of this project motivates others to both improve it and speak on its behalf thus hopefully maximizing its reach. If you would like to learn more and contribute please visit https://freemarketeers.org/ and also consider joining the Libertarian Party's Science Caucus at https://lpsciencecuacus.com to find like-minded people who are interested in spreading scientific freedom. 


## There is obviously something deeply wrong with the state of the world. What is it? The Wisdom of 'The Austrian School of Economics' is the key. 

The global socioeconomic chaos has everyone desperately looking for answers. Prior to the CovidMania, the world had a certain order. Sure there were problems here and there, the usual chaos arising from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, some political upheaval in some Latin American country, the need for the 'Forces of Good' (we Americans) to destroy some "evil" dictatorship in the Middle East led by some "obvious" bad guy like Saddam or Gaddafi...But life for most Americans was a steady increase in prosperity and most of us expected the world to get increasingly peaceful, interconnected, less tribalistic, self-driving cars, and so on. Oh boy, have things changed. Then CovidMania hit in early 2020, Anthony Fauci, The WHO (World Health Organization) and a sort of 'Priesthood of Scientism' essentially became dictators of the world and locked down much of the planet. Suddenly billions of people became potential criminals by just wanting to go about their lives as before. 

To a significant degree Robert Kennedy Jr's book, "The Real Anthony Fauci", being a #1 bestseller on Amazon.com and thus the bestselling book in the world for nearly 2 months, and long after publication a still-bestseller in numerous science-related categories thus an obvious eye-sore to the 'Priesthood of Scientism', is akin to Martin Luther's "95 Theses" which sparked the Protestant Revolution and thus a massive change in the views-mythology of the times. Sixty percent of the book's content deals with the HIV->Death myth, the Fauci-Pope, and essentially the growth and functioning of the 'Priesthood of Scientism'. The vast majority of slightly smarter apes understandably just go along with Fauci's Priesthood as did the masses go along with the Pope's Crusades, but the sheer obvious stupidity of the lockdowns and coerced vaccinations, especially of kids, has greatly accelerated the rate at which that 2-3% of the population that actually reads books and can think a bit more independently is waking up to the fact that so much of mainstream medicine is nonsense and run by incompetent bureaucrats-priests. 

Many Americans and people all over the world are beginning to understand how vital freedom is, and just as importantly, how we must use our rapidly diminishing freedom to organize and defend it, and hopefully start a 'Freedom Reconquista' that not only puts the breaks on the increasing coercive government control, chaos and tyranny, but can enlighten and liberate the whole world from the economic ignorance that ultimately underpins all of our problems.

All living things, from the simplest bacteria, to a complex multicellular animal like a human, and the entire socioeconomic order, are in a constant cycle of the production and consumption of wealth. Due to lockdowns, for months billions of people were prevented from working and thus producing the wealth needed to keep mankind going. The economically clueless politicians and governments thought that by just having their central banks create and send people money, they could have access to wealth and everything would be great. Yes, millions stayed home consuming food, energy, and other wealth without production, thus shrinking the economic pie. A rapidly shrinking economic pie as people just consumed without production, coupled with more money the governments were creating meant more money per existing smaller amounts of wealth and thus higher prices. In the US from early March to mid May 2020, the Federal Reserve created about 3 trillion dollars which eventually led to a 40% increase in gasoline prices, 20% in real estate, and so on, crushing future generations of Americans and millions of Americans whose hard-earned savings will now buy them much less.

Then came the coerced vaccinations. The vaccines were an obvious calamity to anyone who was not part of, or under the sway of, the 'Priesthood of Scientism'. Soon after the vaccines were rolled out, by as early as 12/18/2020 per image below, according to the CDC 1 out of 35 people taking the Covid vaccines were being incapacitated to the point where they were "unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, required care from doctor or health care professional". By 3/25/2023 almost 270 million Americans got at least one dose, that means that almost 8 million Americans were injured to the point where they were "unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, required care from doctor or health care professional". And these were just the clearly visible immediate effects.

There is only one simple statistic needed to show how your average doctor is as willing to go along with harmful mythology as much as the priests during the Spanish Inquisition, or the bureaucrats in Communist regimes. Per below, in over 2.5 years of CovidMania, in a population of over 73 million kids under 18 years old, 1,612 of them died having tested positive for covid. This does not even mean that it was the alleged covid that killed them by itself, they just tested positive and thus considered to be a factor in their deaths. That's 645 kids per year and less than 9 per million. Over this statistically insignificant number which is still based on faulty PCR tests and other layers of pseudoscience, even assuming that testing and diagnosis was 100% correct, over this nonetheless insignificant number the 'Priesthood of Scientism' and its medical priests are attempting to coerce 69 million kids (73 minus 4 million kids under 6 months) to be injected with experimental vaccines-talismans.

And the truly alarming and chilling thing about all this, is that the masses, "experts", and most "intellectual leaders" of the day went along with the calamity and saw critics as heretics. Which brings us to our first couple of quotes from members of the little-known group of intellectuals who hold the key to making sense of it all and get mankind on a path to prosperity, 'The Austrian School of Economics', and men like F.A. Hayek who tells us:

>"It is necessary to realize that the sources of many of the most harmful agents in this world are often not evil men but high-minded idealists, and that in particular the foundations of totalitarian barbarism have been laid by honourable and well-meaning scholars who never recognized the offspring they produced." (Hayek F. A., 1973, p. 70)

Hayek again:

>"Most people are still unwilling to face the most alarming lesson of modern history: that the greatest crimes of our time have been committed by governments that had the enthusiastic support of millions of people who were guided by moral impulses. It is simply not true that Hitler or Mussolini, Lenin or Stalin, appealed only to the worst instincts of their people: they also appealed to some of the feelings which also dominate contemporary democracies." (Hayek F. A., 1976, p. 134)

Then, just as mankind was slowly recovering from the Bolshevik-like rape of civilization CovidMania, the Russia-Ukraine war breaks out. Ukrainian president Zelenskyy told Israeli politicians in a Zoom meeting "You can mediate between countries, but not between good and evil." Great! We are well into the 21st century, over 160 years since Darwin published his 'On the Origin of Species', and we once again find ourselves in a tribalistic mythical war over 'good vs. evil'. Has anything been learned from history? Sadly, no. The tribalistic economically ignorant homo sapiens just keeps doing what is in his nature. “It is human nature that repeats itself, not history.” —John Toland

In August 10, 1915, British physicist Henry Mosely, who would have probably won the Nobel Prize that year, died in perhaps the most disastrous error mankind has thus far made, The First World War (1914–18). Bright and pious slightly smarter apes that had absorbed German-French-British-Russian “identities”… students, fathers, engineers, “great minds” and “experts”, who even shared a common European Christian faith, reverted to their tribal ape-like nature, and for God, honor, flag and country, slaughtered each other leading to about 18 million deaths and millions more left invalid (6.5 million just in France). At 7:30 am July 1st, 1916 the 'Battle of the Somme' began. On this single day, just the British alone, had about 20,000 fatalities and 35,000 wounded. On that day a British soldier was either killed or wounded on average every second. The "honor" of a military career would lead to disproportionately higher losses for the upper classes for all belligerents. Germany's top general, Erich Ludendorff would lose two sons, as would future British Prime Minister Andrew Bonar Law. British Prime Minister at the start of the war, Herbert Asquith, lost one. While about 12% of British troops would die in the war, 31% of Oxford's 1913 graduating class would die. This should help abolish the popular naive myth that politicians are quick to bring about wars while wanting to avoid personal loses in them. Nonsense unfortunately, human beings are slightly smarter apes that have been naturally selected to be vicious killers and to enjoy violence. Warfare-predation was an important evolutionary strategy and one of the reasons we are social and have evolved big brains to begin with. As Steven Pinker writes:

>"… men go to war to get or keep women –not necessarily as a conscious goal of the warriors(though often it is exactly that), but as the ultimate payoff that allowed a willingness to fight to evolve. Access to women is the limiting factor on male's reproductive success. Having two wives can double a man's children, having three wives can triple it, and so on. The most common spoils of tribal warfare are women. Raiders kill the men, abduct the nubile women, gang-rape them, and allocate them as wives." [( Steven Pinker's "How the Mind Works" 1999, p. 510)](https://books.google.com/books?id=5cXKQUh6bVQC&pg=PA510&lpg=PA510&dq=%22men+go+to+war+to+get+or+keep+women+%E2%80%93not+necessarily+as+a+conscious%22&source=bl&ots=4RwtAahW_K&sig=ACfU3U0IXRFzLuCSIqv5V30T72_P_PpzSQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwin-sGOwe7mAhVJoZ4KHbZ5BvAQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22men%20go%20to%20war%20to%20get%20or%20keep%20women%20%E2%80%93not%20necessarily%20as%20a%20conscious%22&f=false)

To be successful in war-hunt you need a strong sense of unity which translates itself into the strong tribalistic-nationalist-militaristic-patriotic tendencies we are so susceptible to and has the planet littered with nuclear weapons and "civilized" taxpayers believing we must have them. The bond men make as co-warriors may be stronger than male-female love. A female is easily replaceable (another raid, etc.) but the loss of that co-warrior that will help get the next female and-or defend you when you only get one chance at life is probably even more important. Just like natural selection has shaped us to enjoy sex due to the vital biological-evolutionary importance, it has also shaped us to enjoy war-violence and easily segregating ourselves into the in-group-us-"good" vs. out-group-them-"evil". Given its importance, war-patriotism easily fills us with a great sense of purpose. England's prime minister during World War Two and national hero Winston Churchill shows us how inspiring, exciting and purposeful World War One was to him when he mentioned:

>"I think a curse should rest on me - because I love this war. I know it's smashing and shattering the lives of thousands every moment - and yet - I can't help it - I enjoy every second of it." [(Churchill)](https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/02/25/churchills-advice/)

Churchill wrote to his wife:

>“Everything tends towards catastrophe and collapse. I am interested, geared up and happy. Is it not horrible to be built like that?”

Churchill also told Prime Minister Asquith that his life’s ambition was:

>“to command great victorious armies in battle.” 

Churchill again:

>"My God! This is living History. Everything we are doing and saying is thrilling… Why I would not be out of this glorious delicious war for anything the world could give me…" [(Churchill, per Margot Asquith)](https://books.google.com/books?id=MzytDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT297&lpg=PT297&dq=%22My+God!+This+is+living+History.+Everything+we+are+doing+and+saying+is+thrilling%22&source=bl&ots=zYG1LaIeSU&sig=ACfU3U3RqPMPBYEmjxIkEd7kh_p8RBiKrw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiiycmAr-7mAhWVoJ4KHSSzAQIQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22My%20God!%20This%20is%20living%20History.%20Everything%20we%20are%20doing%20and%20saying%20is%20thrilling%22&f=false)

Towards the end of WWII, Russia's Red Army is estimated to have raped over 2 million German women. Equally human, the Allies-Americans weren't much better and generally saw the Japanese as an inferior race and cared little for their suffering or views, as US president who needlessly nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Harry S. Truman, mentions in a letter:

>"The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them. When you have to deal with a beast you have to treat him as a beast." [(Truman letter to Samuel McCrea Cavert, General Secretary of The Churches of Christ in America)](http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/correspondence/truman-harry/corr_truman_1945-08-11.htm)

We shouldn't be shocked when men murder, rape and torture, or masturbate to tentacle porn, the real miracle that has taken thousands of years of cultural-legal evolution to create, are the modern cultural values-laws-ideologies-software we absorb that program homo sapiens into respecting the body-property-thoughts of all human beings regardless of age, sex, beliefs, and race. Being the social slightly smarter apes that we are, fellow humans are our biggest assets which helps explain the evolution of altruism-compassion, as well as our biggest competitors which helps us understand our horrendous violence towards fellow men. During the early days in the lead-up to World War I there was an atmosphere of joy and excitement as thousands of young men celebrated and volunteered for the coming war which would bring unity, purpose, and glory. After the war, when much of Europe lay in ruins, many were numb and in a state of stupor wondering how they could have fooled themselves into such needless carnage. Why did this happen? And if it was such a big deal at the time, worth sacrificing so much, how come hardly anybody knows anything about it today? 20 years later via World War Two the tribalistic slaughter led to over 80 million deaths and what followed was a "Cold War" that brought the slightly smarter apes close to nuclear annihilation several times. Why were our "great leaders" and "intellectuals" utterly powerless to prevent the World War One and Two slaughters and were in fact its promoters? How can mankind today build mindbogglingly complex microchips, airplanes, satellites, the Internet and so much more, yet still not have figured out something as simple as peace and always be one spark away from another world-wide tribalistic tyrannical and chaotic calamity as CovidMania, the Russia-Ukraine war, and recurring financial crisis are showing? 

There is something missing from our understanding of how the world works, something as monumental in importance as Darwin's theory of evolution, something that our "leading intellectuals" and "experts" have yet to discover and spread accordingly. Fortunately for mankind that "something" has already been discovered and explained by a group of little-known and widely misunderstood evolutionary intellectuals often-times referred to as ‘The Austrian School of Economics’. And as  F.A. Hayek(1899–1992) writes, their vital insights and “fundamental ideas belong fully and wholly to Carl Menger”[1840–1921]. 

Hayek provides a simple answer to the questions above. However, this answer can be a bit hard to swallow for the prideful slightly smarter apes, but swallow it we must if we are to survive the next World War One-like calamity which might very well result from  Coronavirus-related economic shutdowns-policies, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, or Russia-Ukraine war, etc. The answer is the following: Human beings are slightly smarter apes whose instincts are ideally suited to living in small tribes of less than 100 people but find themselves relatively lost in the modern socioeconomic order where things like money, profit-loss calculation, economic competition, and interest rates coordinate the actions of billions of human beings all over the world to create what the great British 19th century thinker Herbert Spencer referred to as ["The Social Organism"](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/spencer-the-man-versus-the-state-with-six-essays-on-government-society-and-freedom-lf-ed), which can also be seen as an incredibly complex movie-like-Matrix that did not exist 20,000 years ago. 

Tribal warfare, political infighting, coercing each other, rape, and 'The law of the jungle', are things we have been doing for millions of years and are somewhat intuitive. Commercial society, the tolerance and wisdom needed to refrain from coercing others, and understanding the aforementioned economic concepts which have been around for less than a few thousand years, are not. Hayek summarizes:

>"...man’s instincts...were not made for the kinds of surroundings, and for the numbers, in which he now lives. They were adapted to life in the small roving bands or troops in which the human race and its immediate ancestors evolved during the few million years while the biological constitution of homo sapiens was being formed."

It should be easy to realize that all human beings are such slightly smarter apes who grow up absorbing a continuously evolving culture-language-"identity"-ideas-myths which then leads them to act in ways that lead to disorder via conflict-war, or order via peace and prosperity. As Mises tells us:

>"It is ideas that group men into fighting factions, that press the weapons into their hands, and that determine against whom and for whom the weapons shall be used. It is they alone, and not arms, that, in the last analysis, turn the scales."

When a lion takes over a pride and kills the cubs so that the females will once again be ready to mate, we don’t say that the lion is “evil”, we rightly understand the complex evolutionary factors leading to such actions. It is likewise important to look at our socioeconomic disasters (CovidMania, Israel-Palestine, Russia-Ukraine) using an evolutionary lens that is free of "blame" and full of sympathy and understanding. Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Churchill, Roosevelt, Fauci, etc. were not "evil", which is itself a mythical linguistic construct inherited from more religious times, they were fellow homo sapiens adored by their respective masses who absorbed horrendous ideas or myths propagated by scholars arising from the complexity of the economy as in the case of Socialism (Hitler-Lenin-Mao-Roosevelt-etc.), and the biochemical order as in the case of CovidMania and resulting coercive lockdowns and damaging vaccinations and more (Fauci).

Mises again:

>"Neither as judges allotting praise and blame nor as avengers seeking out the guilty should we face the past. We seek truth, not guilt; we want to know how things came about to understand them, not to issue condemnations."

The centuries of slavery, religious slaughters, persecution of minorities, and all man-made calamities were obviously the result, not of mythical "evil" or "madness", but of the ideas and myths held by the slightly smarter apes at the time and the mistaken need to coerce each other, and as long as the masses remain lost in erroneous mythology, democracy obviously does little good. Hayek:

>"Perhaps the fact that we have seen millions voting themselves into complete dependence on a tyrant has made our generation understand that to choose one's government is not necessarily to secure freedom."

It is obvious that we should focus on the ideas instead of vilifying people and assuming sinister motives or madness as the source of our problems, yet the fact that this goes largely unnoticed as we constantly segregate ourselves along political-tribal lines is further evidence that we are such dangerous slightly smarter apes, and just as important as we will soon show, how little a role "reason" plays in creating and sustaining civilization. Focusing on the actions of individual men is irrelevant compared to the evolutionary processes that create the ideas, incentive structures, and circumstances under which he acts. Without the above men's evolutionary insights, as Spencer tells us: 

>"It is as though a child, seeing for the first time a tree from which a gardener is here cutting off a branch and there pruning away smaller parts, should regard the gardener, the only visible agent, as the creator of the whole structure: knowing nothing about the agency of sun and rain, air and soil. Undeveloped intelligences cannot recognize the results of slow, silent, invisible causes."

The complete evolutionary worldview provided by 'The Austrians', arguably reaching its zenith or completion with F.A. Hayek, is still so ridiculously far ahead of our time and mainstream intellectuals that even today's leading thinkers, like renowned popular science writer Matt Ridley, by their own admission are 'still catching up with him'. Ridley humbly acknowledges this in a 2011 speech where he mentions:

>"As someone who came to Fredrick von Hayek comparatively late in life, I'm still catching up with him...Indeed, many of the insights I thought I had discovered in my own readings and writings on the frontier of evolutionary biology and economics it turns out Hayek had long before me...It's Hayek who first puts it all together." - [Matt Ridley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG-grkJPU8Q)


Most people hope that some great intellectual comes along and provides mankind with a great understanding of the world that can get us on a path to peace and prosperity. Plenty of intellectuals are constantly looking for fame and glory by providing such an understanding.

For example, arguably one of today's "leading intellectuals" is Yuval Noah Harari the author of the wildly popular 'Sapiens:  A Brief History of Humankind' which has over 65,000 mostly glowing reviews and recommended by today's leading personalities like Obama, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. Over seven years after its initial publication in 2015, it is still at the top of numerous amazon.com categories. There is a section titled 'The Capitalist Hell' where he writes:

>"Capitalism has killed millions out of cold indifference coupled with greed."

Mr. Harari is deeply mistaken. He and his book are popular not because they are great but because they reinforce and appeal to the leading fallacies of our day. Surely Pope Urban II's views as he launched the Crusades were popular, and so was Karl Marx's Communist manifesto which is sadly the #2 best-seller in Amazon.com's 'Political Philosophy' category. The world is in chaos, because, as we will soon show, its 'leading intellectuals' are essentially clueless.  

As we and like-minded friends hope to show, what is more likely to be the case is that the great intellectuals we hope explain the world and get mankind on a path to prosperity lie in the past and are commonly referred to as 'The Austrian School of Economics', but their ideas are just still ahead of our time. Obama, Gates, Zuckerberg, Hariri and today's 'leading intellectuals', via their global coercive central plans, are once again, inadvertently, and often times with the best of intentions, destroying civilization. 

As Ludwig von Mises wrote over 100 years ago:

>"The intellectual leaders of the peoples have produced and propagated the fallacies which are on the point of destroying liberty and Western civilization. The intellectuals alone are responsible for the mass slaughters which are the characteristic mark of our century. They alone can reverse the trend and pave the way for a resurrection of freedom."

Mises also tells us:

>"The flowering of human society depends on two factors: the intellectual power of outstanding men to conceive sound social and economic theories..."

This part has already been done by the so-called 'Austrians'. Mises continues:

>"and the ability of these or other men to make these ideologies palatable to the majority."

It is this latter part which the authors of this book and like-minded friends all over the world believe we must focus on.

Notice how all man-made calamities, from religious slaughters, to world wars, the recent CovidMania, the escalating Russia-Ukraine war, etc., are always, always, ALWAYYYYYS! the result of large groups of homo sapiens coercing each other via government, forcing each other to go along with the prevailing myths of the times. We have simply not evolved to understand the economic forces that create civilization, the vital need for freedom and privatization, and the immense harm that too much government can do. Supposedly the Dodo bird quickly went extinct because it had not evolved to recognize humans as potential dangers, we similarly just line up for ‘central planning’ and government coordinated self-destruction over and over and over and over. Notice how the biggest companies or 'private sector orders' in the world like Amazon, Apple, Walmart, Google and Microsoft, which hire and efficiently coordinate the actions of millions of fellow homo sapiens across the world regardless of age, sex, religion or race, do not force anyone to buy their products or coerce anyone in any way and have no army or tribalistic and patriotic flag salutations. They spend all of their time peacefully innovating and copying each other’s innovations thus inadvertently spreading superior information and subsequent social order. Yet the human dodos hate the free private sector and love their coercive 'central planners', "great leaders", and governmental structures that reinforce some tribal 'Identity' from which inevitably an 'us vs. them' mentality emerges.

Imagine you had a time machine and went back in time about 300 years to Salem, Massachusetts during the famed Salem witch trials where 19 women were hanged for witchcraft, and told people that the world could function much better if there was no slavery, that women should have the same rights and freedoms as men, that homosexuality should not be criminalized and seen as part of homo sapiens, and that six million years ago we had a common ancestor with chimpanzees (we’ll assume they know what chimps are). People would see you as some devilish monstrosity spreading heretical ideas and quickly “conspire” to kill you. Would this mean that the people of the time were somehow dumb or malicious? Or members of some “vast conspiracy” of “bad guys” or “special interests” intent on taking away your freedoms? Of course not. The people would be fellow homo sapiens acting based on the prevailing myths and incentive structures of the times. If by our modern standards pretty much everything about how people saw the world 300 years ago could be understood as myths, in other words, as “widely held but false beliefs or ideas”, why should we not be open to the idea that we too are likewise immersed in mythology? And also likely to have incentive structures populated by well-intentioned people who also erroneously attempt to silence and kill potential myth-busters? 


Since myths are ideas, how do we discover the best ideas, determine their validity, usefulness and spread them? How do we discover the best information with which to guide our actions and order mankind?

Among numerous great free-market economists of the ‘Austrian School’, Mises' pupil F.A. Hayek([Mick Jagger’s favorite economist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pCZo6iXOfk)), in some of his seminal writings like ‘The Use of Knowledge in Society’ and the aptly titled ‘Competition as a discovery procedure’ helped us realize that the economic competition which emerges from people’s freedom to choose among competing alternatives or ideas is how we motivate the discovery and spread of superior information and subsequent order throughout society. This process of ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ inadvertently turns mankind into a global supercomputer as entrepreneurs via the companies they create are motivated to innovate and have to copy and thus spread each other’s innovations due to billions of minds freely trading their life-sustaining wealth for what they calculate to be best.

Coercion, whether it is by the patriarchy, slave-master, Church, and ultimately government, is not only a burden to those being coerced, but also destroys this wonderful mechanism of ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ which is what has discovered and spread the superior information which replaced erroneous mythology and continuously reordered mankind into increasingly more technologically advanced, productive, and prosperous states. This helps us understand how as the coercive and thus competition-immune-monopolistic decision-making power of the Catholic Church was reduced and individual freedom increased in Europe so did emerging ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ and resulting technological advancements thus taking Western civilization to prominence, but as the social order got mind-bogglingly complex in the late 1800s and Socialist-competition-immune-Central-Planning mythology arose, freedom and emerging ‘competitive knowledge discovery’ was destroyed leading to immense suffering and technological stagnation in Communist countries like the former Soviet Union and pre-Capitalist China.

Wherever there is complexity homo sapiens understandably fools himself with mythology. Religious myths, like The Tower of Babel which provides a mythical explanation as to why people speak different languages, still dominate most people's understanding of the world. In this book we will discuss:

1. How the immense complexity of the socioeconomic order and its evolution leads to central planning mythology.
2. How the complexity of the biochemical order leads to many Scientific myths.
3. How in both cases coercive bureucracies akin to the older coercive religious priesthoods emerge to stifle change and dissent. 
 
Since economic ignorance is the root of our socioeconomic problems, per Mises, we feel it is our "civic duty" to help fellow citizens overcome such ignorance. Mises also writes:

>"Liberalism is rationalistic. It maintains that it is possible to convince the immense majority that peaceful cooperation within the framework of society better serves their rightly understood interests than mutual battling and social disintegration. It has full confidence in man’s reason. It may be that this optimism is unfounded and that the liberals have erred. But then there is no hope left for mankind’s future."

Mises also:

>"The masses follow the lead of the people we call educated. Once convince these, and the game is won."

In other words, we have to believe that we can educate "the immense majority" even if it proves to be futile, otherwise "there is no hope left for mankind's future". Different people have different ideas regarding how to improve the world. Some think we need to be more religious, better Christians or Muslims. Some think people with different political ideologies should segregate themselves accordingly. Some feel like there will always be wars, corrupt or "bad" politicians and chaos, and this is just the way things will always be and we just have to hope for the best. We are Misesians in the sense that we believe that Mises was right, not just in his insights regarding the economy, the evolution of society and more, but also in his strategy of economic education as the key for worldwide peace and prosperity. He writes:

>"If we want to avoid the destruction of Western civilization and the relapse into primitive wretchedness, we must change the mentality of our fellow citizens. We must make them realize what they owe to the much vilified "economic freedom," the system of free enterprise and capitalism."

Also:

>"Economics deals with society's fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen."

And again:

>"It is a fateful error on the part of our most valuable contemporaries to believe that economics can be left to specialists...The issues of society's economic organization are every citizen's business. To master them to the best of one's ability is the duty of everyone."

If we are to quickly save mankind and reach the prosperity we are truly capable of, those of us who've had the miraculous fortune of stumbling upon Mises and fellow 'Austrian School'-thinkers must succeed at spreading their ideas before it is too late. We must find, join, and grow the people who are thoroughly convinced that such quick prosperity can be achieved and thus become beacons of hope and economic education. We must join Mises in the trenches and go over the parapet in his "intellectual battle" against the economic ignorance that threatens civilization.

Mises: 

>"Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders; no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction. Therefore, everyone, in his own interests, must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle. None can stand aside with unconcern; the interests of everyone hang on the result. Whether he chooses or not, every man is drawn into the great historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch has plunged us." (Mises, 1981)


The rest of this book goes as follows:

1.	An introduction to the economic wisdom of ‘The Austrians’ which will help anyone understand and defend real capitalism and economic freedom, as well as understand and appreciate the history of how so many well-intentioned people fooled themselves into Communist mythology and the harm that it did. Every American, actually, every adult should understand the history of the rise and fall of Communism because the lessons apply to government-created tyranny like CovidMania as well as warmongering via World War One, Two, and the current Russia-Ukraine War.

2.	‘The Austrians’ also explained the co-evolution of the modern free market economy with culture. Their wisdom here is also vital for understanding how civilization has emerged and why we have so much socioeconomic chaos all around us.
