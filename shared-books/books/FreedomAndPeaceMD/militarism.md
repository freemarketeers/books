### Homo Sapiens and their Militarism

In August 10, 1915, British physicist Henry Mosely, who would have probably won the Nobel Prize that year, died in perhaps the most disastrous error mankind has thus far made, The First World War (1914–18). Bright and pious slightly smarter apes that had absorbed German-French-British-Russian “identities”… students, fathers, engineers, “great minds” and “experts”, who even shared a common European Christian faith, reverted to their tribal ape-like nature, and for God, honor, flag and country, slaughtered each other leading to about 18 million deaths and millions more left invalid. At 7:30 am July 1st, 1916 the 'Battle of the Somme' began. On this single day, just the British alone, had about 20,000 fatalities and 35,000 wounded. On that day a British soldier was either killed or wounded on average every second. The "honor" of a military career would lead to disproportionately higher losses for the upper classes for all belligerents. Germany's top general, Erich Ludendorff would lose two sons, as would future British Prime Minister Andrew Bonar Law. British Prime Minister at the start of the war, Herbert Asquith, lost one. While about 12% of British troops would die in the war, 31% of Oxford's 1913 graduating class would die. This should help abolish the popular naive myth that politicians are quick to bring about wars while wanting to avoid personal loses in them. Nonsense unfortunately, homo sapiens has been naturally selected to be vicious killers and to enjoy violence. Warfare-predation was an important evolutionary strategy and one of the reasons we are social and have evolved big brains to begin with. 

Given its importance, war-patriotism easily fills us with a great sense of purpose. England's prime minister during World War Two and national hero Winston Churchill shows us how inspiring, exciting and purposeful World War One was to him when he mentioned:

>"I think a curse should rest on me - because I love this war. I know it's smashing and shattering the lives of thousands every moment - and yet - I can't help it - I enjoy every second of it." [(Churchill)](https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/02/25/churchills-advice/)

And in another occasion:

>"My God! This is living History. Everything we are doing and saying is thrilling… Why I would not be out of this glorious delicious war for anything the world could give me…" [(Churchill, per Margot Asquith)](https://books.google.com/books?id=MzytDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT297&lpg=PT297&dq=%22My+God!+This+is+living+History.+Everything+we+are+doing+and+saying+is+thrilling%22&source=bl&ots=zYG1LaIeSU&sig=ACfU3U3RqPMPBYEmjxIkEd7kh_p8RBiKrw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiiycmAr-7mAhWVoJ4KHSSzAQIQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22My%20God!%20This%20is%20living%20History.%20Everything%20we%20are%20doing%20and%20saying%20is%20thrilling%22&f=false)

Chuchill wrote to his wife:

>“Everything tends towards catastrophe and collapse. I am interested, geared up and happy. Is it not horrible to be built like that?”

Churchill also told Prime Minister Asquith that his life’s ambition was:

>“to command great victorious armies in battle.” 


Towards the end of WWII, Russia's Red Army is estimated to have raped over 2 million German women. Equally human, the Allies-Americans weren't much better and generally saw the Japanese as an inferior race and cared little for their suffering or views, as US president who needlessly nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Harry S. Truman, mentions in a letter:

>"The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them. When you have to deal with a beast you have to treat him as a beast." [(Truman letter to Samuel McCrea Cavert, General Secretary of The Churches of Christ in America)](http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/correspondence/truman-harry/corr_truman_1945-08-11.htm)

We shouldn't be shocked when men murder, rape and torture, or masturbate to tentacle porn, the real miracle that has taken thousands of years of cultural-legal evolution to create, are the modern cultural values-laws-ideologies-software we absorb that program homo sapiens into respecting the body-property-thoughts of all human beings regardless of age, sex, beliefs, and race. Being the social slightly smarter apes that we are, fellow humans are our biggest assets which helps explain the evolution of altruism-compassion, as well as our biggest competitors which helps us understand our horrendous violence towards fellow men. 

Unbeknownst to most, today we find ourselves in a situation far, far, far more dangerous than that which led to World War One. The world is littered with nuclear weapons controlled by tribalistic ideologues-apes who know nothing about human nature, history, or economics. Numerous economic fallacies in their world-views inevitably take mankind towards economic warfare via tariffs-sanctions, escalations, alliances, increasing polarization and rate at which sparks ignite, until the statistical certainty that another all-out disaster occurs, and the USA is accelerating this process tremendously with nearly weekly sparks in its dealings with Russia, China, Turkey, Syria, Iran, North Korea, etc. Every year, well over 1.2 trillion dollars worth of civilian wealth in terms of homes, cars, energy, medicines, etc., (an amount similar to the entire productive output of Mexico which has the world's 15th largest economy), is consumed by the millions of people employed by the United State's national security bureaucracy-military and its associated contractors as they produce push-ups, military drills, nukes and other weapons of destruction. In 2015, for every dollar spent in research and development by the world’s ten biggest R&D spending corporations, companies that harmoniously integrate and nourish some of the most hardworking and talented people from nearly every corner-faith-ethnicity of the world, companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Volkswagen and six others…the United States’ National Security-Military bureaucracy consumed nine dollars (109 billion compared to over 1 trillion). In all likelihood, yearly US Military-related spending-consumption is comparable to what the entire planet spends on research and development. Militaries, being massive government MONOPOLIES which are also protected by flag-waving tribalism-patriotism, take wasteful inefficiency to unprecedented levels leading to [$1,280 cups, $999 pliers, and $640 toilet seats.](https://mises.org/power-market/f-35-15-trillion-boondoggle) 

The meme below is another powerful reminder of the economic ignorance that is destroying the American economy.

As a young man in Saudi Arabia, Osama bin laden studied economics and business administration at King Abdulaziz University and his understanding of economics became his main weapon. By motivating his enemies(Russia and USA) to increase military spending-consumption he caused them to sort of destroy themselves from within, making Paul Krugman bin Laden's best soldier.
He tells us his strategy:

>“We, alongside the mujahedeen, bled Russia for 10 years until it went bankrupt and was forced to withdraw in defeat,”
>“We are continuing this policy in bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy. Allah willing, and nothing is too great for Allah,”
>“All that we have to do is to send two mujahedeen to the furthest point east to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al Qaeda, in order to make generals race there to cause America to suffer human, economic and political losses without their achieving anything of note other than some benefits for their private corporations,”
>“Every dollar of al Qaeda defeated a million dollars, by the permission of Allah, besides the loss of a huge number of jobs,”
>“As for the economic deficit, it has reached record astronomical numbers estimated to total more than a trillion dollars.”
>“And it all shows that the real loser is you,”…“It is the [American people and their economy.”](https://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/11/01/binladen.tape/)
 


Mankind is already fortunate to have made it this far without a nuclear war. For example, during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, had it not been for Russian submarine commander Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov's sole dissenting vote in a decision to launch a nuclear strike against the USA, mankind might have already suffered a nuclear holocaust. The horrific mindset of top military and political leaders-apes is perfectly captured in Daniel Ellsberg's great book "The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner". In a discussion of Ellsberg's book, famed intellectual Noam Chomsky summarizes:

>"The things that I learned in the book were hair-raising. For example, I learned… that during the Eisenhower period and basically carried on, there was one war plan, and the war plan was that if there was a confrontation with the Russians in Berlin,whatever, maybe a small confrontation, then immediately we wipe out every city in China… There was no alternative plan, that was the plan… A war could be set off just by inadvertence. There is case after case…where we came extremely close to war just by inadvertence. Sometimes reckless actions on the part of leaders, but sometimes just accidents that happen…When the first early warning system was established to detect incoming missiles…It turns out this new sophisticated system…In the first day of operation it detected a Russian missile attack with 99.9% certainty…That kind of thing happens over and over and the war plans are setup so that if somebody acts on that 99% a billion people die…Page after page of the book contains graphic example of this kind of, you can only call it insanity" - [Chomsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foati7DWvzE)

Let that sink in. Over some tribalistic scuffle in Berlin, which ultimately came down to economic ideology-ignorance, the incineration of hundreds of millions of Chinese and a probable terrestrial life-ending environmental catastrophe. The upper echelons of the US military-leadership is packed with slightly smarter apes who see the world similarly and one can be certain that so are the corresponding Chinese-Russian-Israeli military apes. For example, during the Vietnam War, President Nixon mentioned to then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that "I'd rather use the nuclear bomb" and "The only place where you and I disagree … is with regard to the bombing…You're so goddamned concerned about the civilians and I don't give a damn. I don't care." As technological progress continues to accelerate, it is just a matter of time before any disgruntled group can manufacture a device as damaging as a nuke, or cause enough havoc in a few major cities to cause devastating disruptions to global trade-production which can be just as damaging to the social order as if entire cities are wiped out. The world had plenty of so-called "experts" and scholars in 1914 and 1939 when the world wars got started. Nothing has changed!

The Israeli-Palestininan conflict, which is an outgrowth of a complex web of Jew-Gentile-religious misunderstandings and historical mishaps for which no group of people are to blame, is of vital importance because it radiates naive 'good vs. evil' thinking which has obviously polarized so much of the world. It is discouraging to see how even well educated people who have the best of intentions and have spent a lifetime looking at this conflict can end up vilifying each other. One of Israel's most popular scholarly defenders, Dr. Alan Dershowitz has written a book whose title is very revealing: “The Case Against Israel’s Enemies: Exposing Jimmy Carter and Others Who Stand in the Way of Peace”.  Even a well-intentioned nice old man like former US President Jimmy Carter finds himself on the wrong side of good vs. evil (from Dershowitz’s perspective) for having researched the history and circumstances which shape the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and arriving at conclusions which have been at times critical of the Israeli government. In an interview with Shalom TV, Dershowitz said the following about Jimmy Carter:

>“Jimmy Carter has literally become such an anti-Israel bigot that there is a kind of special place in hell reserved for somebody like that. He has no sympathy or understanding for the suffering of the Jewish people, the plight of the Jewish people, he loves every Muslim extremist he can find...If you're an Israeli, Carter doesn't like you and if you're an Arab or a Muslim, he likes you.” (Dershowitz)

When it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, getting pigeonholed into “good” or “evil” is very easy. As the title of Dershowitz’s book implies, Carter is not just a man who might disagree with the Israeli government and its policies, he is an enemy of Israel, something truly sinister. Ben Shapiro is another increasingly popular conservative Jewish voice who I believe is making great contributions when it comes to preaching free-market economics and criticizing  [the massive economic ignorance that plagues "the left"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIAyudtNicY), but perhaps understandably so since he is Jewish, he wrote a scary critique of Carter whose title says it all ["Jimmy Carter: Emissary of Evil"](https://townhall.com/columnists/benshapiro/2008/04/16/jimmy-carter-emissary-of-evil-n832387) and starts with "Jimmy Carter is an evil man. It is painful to label a past president of the United States as a force for darkness." What hope is there for average politicians and citizens who know even less about the conflict?


It should be easy to realize that all homo sapiens grow up absorbing a continuously evolving culture-language-"identity"-ideas-myths which then leads them to act in ways that lead to disorder via conflict-war, or order via peace and prosperity. As Mises tells us:

>"It is ideas that group men into fighting factions, that press the weapons into their hands, and that determine against whom and for whom the weapons shall be used. It is they alone, and not arms, that, in the last analysis, turn the scales."

When a lion takes over a pride and kills the cubs so that the females will once again be ready to mate, we don’t say that the lion is “evil”, we rightly understand the complex evolutionary factors leading to such actions. It is likewise important to look at our socioeconomic disasters using an evolutionary lens that is free of "blame" and full of sympathy and understanding. Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Churchill, Roosevelt, Fauci, etc. were not "evil", which is a linguistic construct inherited from more religious times, they were fellow homo sapiens adored by their respective masses who absorbed horrendous ideas or myths propagated by scholars arising from the complexity of the economy as in the case of Socialism (Hitler-Lenin-Mao-Roosevelt-etc.), and the biochemical order as in the case of CovidMania and resulting coercive lockdowns and damaging vaccinations and more (Fauci). As Hayek tells us:

>"It is necessary to realize that the sources of many of the most harmful agents in this world are often not evil men but high-minded idealists, and that in particular the foundations of totalitarian barbarism have been laid by honourable and well-meaning scholars who never recognized the offspring they produced." (Hayek F. A., 1973, p. 70)


>"Most people are still unwilling to face the most alarming lesson of modern history: that the greatest crimes of our time have been committed by governments that had the enthusiastic support of millions of people who were guided by moral impulses. It is simply not true that Hitler or Mussolini, Lenin or Stalin, appealed only to the worst instincts of their people: they also appealed to some of the feelings which also dominate contemporary democracies." (Hayek F. A., 1976, p. 134)


The centuries of slavery, religious slaughters, persecution of minorities, and all man-made calamities were obviously the result, not of "evil" or "madness", but of the ideas and myths held by homo sapiens at the time and the mistaken alleged need to coerce each other, and as long as the public remains lost in erroneous mythology, democracy obviously does little good. Hayek:

>"Perhaps the fact that we have seen millions voting themselves into complete dependence on a tyrant has made our generation understand that to choose one's government is not necessarily to secure freedom."

It is obvious that we should focus on the ideas instead of vilifying people and assuming sinister motives or madness as the source of our problems, yet the fact that this goes largely unnoticed as we constantly segregate ourselves along political-tribal-identity lines is further evidence that we are potentially dangerous slightly smarter apes.

We need the wisdom of 'The Austrian School of Economics' in order to understand the root causes of the misunderstandings and complex factors which eventually cause fellow homo sapiens to hate each other.

The current and escalating Russia-Ukraine war is once again polarizing homo sapiens into the forces of "good":

and "darkness"-"evil":

Really???!!! What a mess! These slightly smarter apes are neither "evil" nor "mad" they are what inevitably emerges from economic ignorance.
